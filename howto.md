## join a project
 read all project proposals on github, if you are interested in one of them contact the proposers (identified at the top of the template). Tell them how you plan to contribute


## propose a project
1. describe the idea in the \#ideas channel on slack. Get initial feedback
2. if it seems like it would work write a "proposal" using the template [templateToProposeProject.md](templateToProposeProject.md)
3. if you can fill in all fields notify the [organizers](organizers.md) (ideally on slack) that the proposal is ready. If you cannot fill in some fields continue discussing this in \#ideas on slack

## prepare a pitch

 
 ## build a team
 
 if you proposed a project you should build a team to work on it. Make sure you assamble a team with all the required expertise. If you cannot do that with the volunteers that offer to join your team first ask in the \#i_am_looking_for_someone_who_can slack channel, then if you are still not lucky consider a rescoping that is supported by your current team. Feel free to contact the organizers as well
