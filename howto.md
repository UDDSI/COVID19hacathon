## join a project
 read all project proposals on github, if you are interested in one of them contact the proposers (identified at the top of the template). Tell them how you plan to contribute


## propose a project
1. describe the idea in the \#ideas channel on slack. Get initial feedback
2. if it seems like it would work write a "proposal" using the template [templateToProposeProject.md](templateToProposeProject.md)
3. if you can fill in all fields notify the [organizers](organizers.md) (ideally on slack) that the proposal is ready. If you cannot fill in some fields continue discussing this in \#ideas on slack

## prepare a pitch

Prepare a **2 minutes max** presentation, your project pitch, which will be shown on the first day: in this presentation clearly state the question and its relevance, the deliverable, and the skills required. You can have 1 slide if you need it. Deliver the slide to [Federica Bianco](mailto:fbianco@udel.edu) by thursday 10PM


 
 ## build a team
 
 if you proposed a project you should build a team to work on it. Make sure you assamble a team with all the required expertise. If you cannot do that with the volunteers that offer to join your team first ask in the \#i_am_looking_for_someone_who_can slack channel, then if you are still not lucky consider a rescoping that is supported by your current team. Feel free to contact the organizers as well
 
 ## prepare a presentation
 
 You will have only a few minutes to present, how many will depend on how many teams are formed. 
 - Prepare 2-5 slides that describe the problem, the proposed solution, the result if any, the difficulties you encountered. 
 - Make sure you highlight what did not go right in the process, this will help you or others continue developing this project
 - Make sure you list your team members!
 - Tell everyone if you intent to continue working on the project, and if so other participants that are interested in contributing should contact you, or if you are ok with others pushing the project forward without you
 - Decide who will present. It can be more than one person, but the presentations are very short so likely having more than one or two presenter would be difficult
 - Make sure your slides and graphics and readable. Hints to prepare accessible visual content can be found [here](https://github.com/fedhere/FBBTeamResources/blob/master/AccessibleVisualContent.md)
 
 Every team has to report on what they did by presenting at the end of the day. 
 This hacathon has no competitive component, and in any case a "winning" hack would not necessarily be one that *completed* a project, but rather one that contributed to the solution the most, even if that means that the team identified the proposed solution as noti viable. So there is no pressure about presenting a finished work. Everyone knows that this is a hackathon, that time is minimal, and that the goal was to explore ideas.
