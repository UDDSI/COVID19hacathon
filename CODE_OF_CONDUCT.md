<span class="c8"></span>

<span class="c7">TL;DR. Be respectful and kind. Harassment and abuse are

unsafe please consult one of the organizers by direct message on slack
or by email. </span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Harassment includes but is not limited to:
intimidation, online stalking, harassing, belittling, recording images
or dialogs without permission, sustained disruption or interruptions,
offensive verbal or written comments related categories to gender, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images,
and unwelcome sexual attention. </span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Attendees should not use sexualized images, activities,
or other material both in their hack presentations and in communication
with other participants. </span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">If what you’re doing is making someone feel
uncomfortable that is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked
to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
 </span>

<span class="c2"></span>
