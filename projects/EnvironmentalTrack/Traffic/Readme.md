## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
**TL;DR Using vehicle traffic data to analyze traffic reduction and compliance to ordinances in the current COVID-19 crisis**

Help to do work on identifying and adapting existing image/video classifiers, manual annotation for training, and conventional data analysis is needed to produce progress or results at the Friday event.

## DELIVERABLE:
- Statistical analysis: a measure of traffic reduction in correspondence with policy regulation changes and throug the evolution of the COVID crisis

## SKILLS NEEDED:
- Expertise/interest in image processing (software and expertise are avalable that makes image processing and image detection very easy so this is a great opportunity to learn!)
- Expertise/interest in image annotation (manual annotation for training)
## DATA:
The data was collected by Pro. Chase.
There were several limited data sets collected in January that can be used as "before" benchmarks.  
And, of course, collections can continue past the event, to document metrics going forward as opening and other behavior changes are made in the state.  
The data is available to use or any other Hackathorn idea or and any specialized data collections you would like can be requested.
