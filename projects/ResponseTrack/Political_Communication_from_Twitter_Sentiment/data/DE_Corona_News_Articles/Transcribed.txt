Maria Matos for joining me today seeing the Latin American community center our trusted partners in the Hispanic community and we value their partnership here at the HSS today the two of us and all of you are good examples of how we can practice social distancing and still get out essential information in our new world under Clovis 19 before I share a few numbers about the spread of corona virus in Delaware I want to offer these words to members of the human Hispanic community in their state I am a family doctor by training and have volunteered in many underserved communities including here in Delaware please hear these words do not be afraid to call a doctor if you have symptoms of kovat 19 do not be afraid if a doctor refers you for testing do not be afraid if your test is positive and most of all do not be afraid if you or someone from your family needs medical care because your symptoms become severe we are all here state government and the medical community to help you we want you and your family to feel safe and most importantly we will respect your right to privacy such as dinner or not health records are protected by law and are private you and your family have a right to privacy and for all of us that get justice and all of the health care providers of our state's your families health is our highest priority now let me share details about what's happening in terms of coronavirus cases in delaware as of tuesday afternoon we have 928 total lab confirmed cases across our state 571 cases in New Castle County 147 in tent 200 in Sussex with an age range from 1 to 97 currently there are 147 people hospitalized in Delaware including 52 were critically ill and sadly 16 delawarians have passed away on the hopeful side of Cove is 19 in our state's 144 Delawareans have recovered and we have a total of seven thousand six hundred twenty eight negative cases because this virus is highly contagious and anyone who is infected whether they know it or not can spread it to two or more people we all need to behave as if we already do have coded 19 that is why we must end unnecessary contact with others continue to practice social distancing go out for essential groceries or prescription only as needed and go to work if we are in innocence and please consider wearing a cloth face mask when you do go out now let me say a few words about testing in order to be tested you must have a referral from your primary care doctor or better yet through a telemedicine service associated with your health plan or provider once you have that referral you will be directed to a testing location if you do not have a doctor please call Delaware 2 1 1 or 7 1 1 for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing an operator will connect you with the medical professional to evaluate your symptoms and make the referral as needed is critical you do not go to your local emergency room you have some affect others it is important that we keep the emergency department as free as possible to care for the sickest people and just a reminder about the symptoms of code 19 that will likely lead to testing they are a fever of 99.5 ha or shortness of breath the other symptoms we are seeing are sore throat and body aches if you are held I am free of symptoms we need you to stay that way you and your family can help us by following those steps we've repeated so many times wash your hands often and for twenty seconds including the backs of your hands and under your nails teen commonly used surfaces for clipping toss or sneeze into your elbow and if you use a tissue throw it away if you work in an essential job and are sick to stay home whether it's the flu intestinal problems or even a cold call your doctor and consult with a telemedicine doctor to see if you need to be tested for clova 19 finally as a mom of two little ones and the daughter of older parents I understand the worries that so many Delawareans have today we will get through this crisis by sticking together bring support to one another and doing what we can to support those in need in our community if you have questions please call Delaware 2 1 1 or 7 1 1 for people who are deaf or hard of hearing or send an email to DPH call the ALL at Delaware gov and for the latest updates please visit our website at de gov backflash / liar thank you and now turn it over to Maria to share a few words

Posada salvadora Maria Matos good morning I'm going to repeat what I said in in Spanish good morning I am Maria Matos president and CEO of the Latin American community center I want to thank cabinet secretary oldham Walker for inviting me today and giving me the opportunity to speak to our Latino community together it is comforting to know no mean doing critical periods in our state the leadership of the state thinks of everyone the militant of the Latin stander is to empower the Latino community through education advocacy partnerships and exceptional services it is these types of partnerships as the one we have with the division with the Department of Health and Social Services dr. Odom that helps fulfilled our mission at the Latin Center all the essential services have remained open the family support services offering emergency food and crisis alleviation for the young documented in our immigrant families and as an emergency childcare to provide care to children of essential workers we're following all health and safety precautions sent by the governor and childcare licensing one of my is one of my staff said it feels like Fort Knox in there for those children who are homebound we're posting a morning meeting read aloud small group activities and afternoon meetings afternoon meeting each day to eat classrooms Facebook group our Family Services workers also continue to work faced via Facebook what's up and on the phone keeping in contact with families connecting them with crisis alleviation and food and be in their support system through this crisis bilingual education materials on the coronavirus is also included in every single box of food we give out materials that help families navigate through these very difficult times we also make sure that any information for our community is in Spanish and we place these materials on all our social media platforms and disseminate it through our news media outlets unlike many American workers undocumented immigrants cannot count on the social safety net where they lose their jobs or get sick most do not have health insurance and the people they encounter at risk most are not eligible for unemployment insurance or the cash payment included in the two trillion relief package Congress passed last month one of our moms follows a strict routine when she returns from work removing her shoes outside washing her clothes daily and not allowing her children to hug her until she has taken a shower because she's not sure if she has the virus or not they're scared they're scared about the virus they're scared about ice they're scared about almost everything right now they fear seeking help afraid that this country will see them as just trying to take advantage of the system we're currently working on an additional partnership with Christiana Care because health care is so important where they are hoping to open a Kovach 19 screening station they were looking for a space in the community that had an option for a waiting area an area for a community educator to help community members with resources in a private area for a registered nurse and telemedical anatella medical provider and of course hand-washing a hand washing area we offered the manulito also building on the corner of 3rd and Harrison as all the staff is working remotely and we have placed the Adult Learning and ESL classes online the project is still developing but if I know Christiana care they will meet their target opening date of April 13th I hope this project will help alleviate some of the fears our community is experiencing about getting healthcare or calling going to to get health services and because it is housed at the LA CC and they trust us I'm confident that this project will be a huge success as is the LACC to my community I say keep your distance stay at home car not call 2-1-1 if you need help in closing keep the faith this too shall pass salvadora Maria Matos Mucha Gracia gracias muchas gracias preguntas para ustedes la primera Picanto quiero hacer simi trabajo man via a casa por and para dar necesito ayuda para pagar miss cuentas what do I do if I am sent home from work sick and I need help with my bills well if you're sent home from your if you're homesick the first thing you need to do is call your doctor second thing is called 2-1-1 to get information as to where you can get help with your bills lo lo primero si si si lo manthang a su casa Sisu empleado c2 patron demanda su casa por que -
