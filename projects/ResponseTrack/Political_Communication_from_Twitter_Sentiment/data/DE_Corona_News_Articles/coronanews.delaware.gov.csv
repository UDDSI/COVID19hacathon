"Governor Carney Reschedules Presidential Primary for July 7 - State of Delaware News","Department of Elections","Featured Posts","Governor John Carney","Thursday, May 7, 2020","All eligible Delaware voters will receive absentee ballot applications by mail WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Thursday signed the fifteenth modification to his State of Emergency declaration, rescheduling Delaware’s presidential primary for July 7. The Delaware Department of Elections will mail absentee ballot applications to all registered Democrats and Republicans in the State of Delaware, providing all eligible registered Delaware voters the opportunity to vote by absentee ballot in the presidential primary election.  Governor Carney’s updated order also formalizes interim steps announced on Tuesday, allowing certain small businesses to resume limited operations effective 8:00 a.m. on Friday, May 8. Read Governor Carney’s updated order. “Delawareans have a basic, fundamental right to vote, and these changes will allow all Delaware voters to safely exercise that right,” said Governor Carney. “We are making progress. Delawareans have helped flatten the curve by staying home, and by practicing social distancing when you’re out in public. But this fight isn’t over.  Don’t go out in public unnecessarily, and wear a face covering when you do. Wash your hands often. Delawareans should stay vigilant, and stay informed at de.gov/coronavirus.” Eligible Delaware voters will be permitted to select the “sick” or “temporarily or permanently physically disabled” options on their absentee ballot application to cast a vote in the presidential primary election, even if they are not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. Voters must return the application to the Delaware Department of Elections or complete the process online to receive an absentee ballot. The Delaware Department of Elections will operate at least six polling places in each county to allow voters to cast ballots in person should they choose not to vote by absentee ballot.  Governor Carney’s order on Thursday also reschedules school board elections for July 21, and places additional requirements on municipalities that are conducting elections. The order requires districts and municipalities to enforce social distancing during elections, require face coverings, and limit crowds to 10 or fewer people at polling places.  Governor Carney’s State of Emergency declaration – including the stay-at-home order and mandatory 14-day quarantine for out-of-state travelers – remains in place and carries the force and effect of law. Violations of the order, or any of its modifications, constitute a criminal offense.  Anyone with a question about COVID-19, whether related to medical or social service needs, should call Delaware 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

"Governor Carney Announces Interim Steps Allowing Small Businesses; Universal Testing in Nursing Homes - State of Delaware News","Featured Posts","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","Tuesday, May 5, 2020","Retail, hair dressers able to resume limited services while maintaining health guidelines WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Tuesday announced a series of interim steps allowing small businesses to resume limited operations effective 8:00 a.m. on Friday, May 8. The goal of the interim steps is to provide economic relief to Delaware citizens and businesses who are struggling financially – while maintaining strict adherence to health and safety guidelines. The steps also will help as Delawareans and Delaware businesses adapt to new ways of operating once Phase 1 begins.  Also on Tuesday, Governor Carney and the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) announced a plan to test all residents and staff of Delaware long-term care facilities for COVID-19. DPH will provide facilities with tests, testing supplies, training, and support for the universal testing program to protect the most vulnerable Delawareans. Expanding COVID-19 testing capacity for vulnerable populations is a requirement of federal guidance for economic reopening. Public health experts at the Division of Public Health (DPH) will support clinicians at long-term care facilities with the new testing program. DPH will provide guidance on testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic persons and the interpretation of results.  DPH will also provide recommendations to protect residents and staff based on results, including transmission-based precautions, isolation, and patient and staff management strategies. “I understand how hard this has been for Delawareans across our state. We’ve tried to find ways to ease the pain without compromising public health,” said Governor Carney. “But even these limited steps allowing businesses to offer additional services will require strict compliance with safety standards, especially social distancing. We cannot afford to go backwards and see new cases and hospitalizations spike. Getting used to a new normal won’t be easy, but this is the first step to being able to reopen our economy.” “Residents of long-term care facilities are extremely vulnerable to complications from the virus that causes COVID-19 due to chronic health conditions,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, Director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. “We are incredibly pleased to be able to support this testing strategy which will enable us to help the facilities better identify outbreaks among both staff and residents and contain the spread of the disease through a variety of interventions. It is an important component in our rapidly expanding testing strategy.” Below are the interim steps the Governor announced are effective at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, May 8:  Small business retailers will be allowed to do business using curbside pickup as long as social distancing can be maintained.  These retailers include:  Clothing stores Shoe stores Sporting goods, hobby, musical instruments Book, periodical, music stores Department stores Tobacco and Vape Other general merchandise Office supply, stationery, and gift stores Used merchandise stores Consumer goods rental   Jewelry stores may do business by appointment only, and the Governor has instructed the Division of Small Business to consider additional changes like this for other similar retailers. Cosmetology: Hair care services only are permitted to be offered, and only to workers at essential businesses. Guidelines include:  No more than two appointments at a time per location (and never more than the number of available staff, so just one for a sole proprietor). Need to leave 15 minutes between appointments for proper cleaning. Employees and customers must wear cloth face masks at all times, and customers must cancel appointments if they have any reason to believe they may be ill or may have come into contact with the virus. Staff must wear disposable gloves when providing services and must throw away gloves between customers and wash hands. Employer must require employees to report their temperature daily — above 99.5 means they are ineligible to work. Customer stations must be sanitized between use, along with any equipment used for the customer. In addition, any item a customer handles (like a magazine) must leave with the customer. Entrance door must remain locked to outside to prevent walk-ins.   Other     Golf carts allowed at courses for 1 rider at a time with proper cleaning between customers Drive-in movies are permitted, but patrons must remain inside vehicles and social distancing must be maintained at all times.    Employees required to report to work as a result of these changes will now be permitted to utilize child care services, provided neither parent works from home and they do not have alternate care. Anyone with a question about COVID-19, whether related to medical or social service needs, should call Delaware 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Or text your ZIP code to 898-211. Hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  Questions can also be submitted by email at DPHCall@delaware.gov.

"Delaware Social Services Approved for Pandemic EBT to Feed Children During COVID-19 Emergency - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","News","","Tuesday, May 5, 2020","NEW CASTLE (May 5, 2020) – On May 1, the Division of Social Services was approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to operate Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT), a new program authorized by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that provides assistance to families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. The P-EBT program provides a supplemental food-purchasing benefit to current Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households and a new EBT benefit to other eligible households to offset the cost of meals that would have otherwise been available at school. Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, states may submit a plan to the Secretary of Agriculture for providing P-EBT benefits to SNAP and non-SNAP households with children who have temporarily lost access to free or reduced-price school meals due to pandemic-related school closures. State agencies may operate P-EBT when a school is closed for at least five consecutive days during a public health emergency designation during which the school would otherwise be in session. Gov. John Carney declared a State of Emergency on March 13, all Delaware schools were closed as of March 16, and Gov. Carney announced April 24 that schools would remain closed through the end of the school year. This closure will result in an average total of 65 canceled school days. For the 2019-2020 school year, Delaware has approximately 100,000 children eligible for free or reduced-priced school meals who are now eligible to receive P-EBT benefits. The P-EBT benefits will be issued as a supplement to SNAP households on their existing EBT cards and to non-SNAP households on a new EBT card along with details on how to use the card. Households that are not receiving SNAP will automatically receive one P-EBT card in the mail for all eligible children in their household. “The Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer program is an important way for the Department of Health and Social Services to ensure that children will get the nutrition they need, especially with schools closed for the remainder of the school year,” said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. “We are grateful for the approval of Delaware’s program by the USDA.” Delaware will follow the P-EBT benefit guidance provided by the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service. The P-EBT benefit amount is equal to the federal reimbursement rate for breakfast and lunch at the rate of $5.70 per child, per canceled school day. Eligible households will receive P-EBT benefits as follows:      P-EBT Issuance Month SNAP Households Non-SNAP Households   March & April 2020 Amount: $193.80 per child Issuance Date: week of May 11 Amount: $193.80 per child Issuance Date: mid-May   May 2020 Amount: $119.70 per child Amount: $119.70 per child   June 2020 Amount: $57.00 per child Amount: $57.00 per child      The implementation of P-EBT in Delaware helps to keep families healthy and children fed during this national emergency. Households will receive written notification regarding P-EBT benefits."

Attorney General highlights domestic violence awareness amid emergency orders  Attorney General Kathy Jennings and the Delaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence announced Monday that more than 100 cell phones with prepaid calls, texts, and data will be made available to Delaware domestic violence survivors as the result of a public-private-nonprofit collaboration between the Delaware Department of Justice, the Delaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and industry donors. “You don’t need to stay home if home isn’t safe,” said Attorney General Jennings. “The tragic reality is that while home is the safest place for most of us during this pandemic, the opposite is true for victims of domestic violence or child abuse who feel trapped and silenced by their abusers. Our number one priority is saving lives, and connecting survivors with these cell phones puts a resource in their hands that can help them start to rebuild the life they deserve.” Prepaid phones offer a measure of privacy, protection, and independence to survivors who may feel economically trapped in an abusive situation because of reliance on an abuser’s phone plan. They also ensure that survivors’ activity—including calls for help—are not reflected in abuser’s monthly cell phone plans and equip survivors with a vital tool as they rebuild their lives. “DCADV is so grateful to Delaware’s Attorney General, Kathy Jennings, for her advocacy for victims of domestic violence,” Sue Ryan, Executive Director of the Delaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “The availability of safe phones is a critical resource for connecting victims of domestic violence to supportive services.” Phones will be distributed throughout the state to victim advocates and made available to victims as needed. The announcement comes amid a larger set of domestic violence and child abuse awareness campaigns by nonprofits like DCADV and state agencies including the DOJ, the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families (DSCYF), and the Delaware Courts’ Office of the Child Advocate. Delaware’s State of Emergency has not interrupted the availability of resources for survivors, including Protection from Abuse court orders; shelter, hotels or other emergency housing; advocates and attorneys to assist petitioners through the Family Court process; and social workers and counselors in a variety of different agencies. The following 24-hour hotlines are also available:  New Castle County: (302) 762-6110 Kent & Sussex County: (302) 422-8058 Español: (302) 745-9874  A complete listing of services is available at dcadv.org. Information on protections through the Courts are available at courts.delaware.gov/family or (302) 255-0300. Police-based Victim Service staff are also available to address the needs of crime victims.  More information and phones numbers can be found at dsp.delaware.gov/victim-services."

"Governor Carney and Six Governors Announce Joint Multi-State Agreement to Develop Regional Supply Chain - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Sunday, May 3, 2020","States Will Aggregate Demand for PPE, Medical Equipment and Testing on a Regional Basis Regional Supply Chains Will Help Realize Better Pricing, Delivery and Reliability of PPE and Medical Equipment for States   WILMINGTON, Del. – Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Delaware Governor John Carney, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker today announced a joint multi-state agreement to develop a regional supply chain for personal protective equipment, other medical equipment and testing. While the states will continue to partner with the federal government during this global and national public health crisis, they will also work together to identify the entire region’s needs for these products, aggregate demand among the states, reduce costs and stabilize the supply chain. The states will also coordinate policies regarding the inventory of PPE each state’s health care infrastructure should have to be prepared for a possible second wave of COVID-19. The states will also coordinate policies on what supplies local governments should have on hand for their First Responders, and if any requirements regarding PPE for the non-for-profit and private sector are needed. The states will then seek to identify suppliers within the country, region or state who can scale to meet the demand of the entire region over the next three months. The goal of this approach is to decrease the potential for disruptions in the supply chain for PPE and medical equipment, including sanitizer and ventilators, and testing, and promote regional economic development. In addition, the states are discussing how to collectively explore emerging technologies on an ongoing basis to take advantage of the potential associated with alternative methods of production for existing products and innovation that would lead to more effective and/or less expensive alternatives. For example, 3D Printers may represent an attractive alternative to manufacturing certain personal protective equipment and medical products. “We need a consistent approach for moving our states out of this crisis, and that includes ensuring a sufficient supply of PPE and tests,” said Governor Carney. “I’m thankful for this coordination with my fellow Governors in the region. We’ll be better positioned to continue tackling this crisis working together with the states around us.” Governor Cuomo said, “The COVID-19 pandemic created a mad scramble for medical equipment across the entire nation – there was competition among states, private entities and the federal government and we were driving up the prices of these critical resources. As a state and as a nation we can’t go through that again. We’re going to form a regional state purchasing consortium with our seven northeast partner states to increase our market power when we’re buying supplies and help us actually get the equipment at a better price. I want to thank our neighboring states for their ongoing support, generosity and regional coordination on these important efforts.” Governor Murphy said, “Our states should never be in a position where we are actively competing against each other for life-saving resources. By working together across the region, we can obtain critical supplies as we begin the process to restart our economies, while also saving money for our taxpayers. This concept is at the heart of the regional approach we’ve established.” Governor Lamont said, “With global supply chains continuing to experience a major disruption due to the pandemic, combining the efforts of our states into a regional purchasing initiative will help our states obtain needed PPE and other medical equipment without competing against each other. I’ve long been advocating for the federal government to get involved because pitting all 50 states against each other to compete for these supplies has never made any sense. Partnering with our neighbors helps make our purchasing power stronger and more dependable.” Governor Wolf said, “By working together we can combine our strengths to build the capacities we all need. We can exploit our market size to encourage producers to make what we need, we can exploit our financial strength to give that encouragement added weight, and we can exploit the great research institutions and the brainpower in our region to increase our chances of success. I look forward to working with my fellow governors—and my neighbors-to build a strong regional supply chain.” Governor Raimondo said, “Our healthcare workers should never have to worry if we have enough PPE to keep them safe. Over the past two months, we’ve been scouring the earth for supplies and have worked hard to meet the demand on the frontlines. We know that, in order to safely reopen the economy, we need a long-term supply of PPE for all critical infrastructure workers. I look forward to continuing to collaborate with states across the region in order to build and maintain a steady, reliable and affordable supply of PPE.” Governor Baker said, “Massachusetts looks forward to working with other states to identify more options for PPE procurements for our health care workers and public safety personnel.” ###"

Other symptoms such as headache or digestive symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or lack of appetite) have been identified as potential symptoms related to COVID-19 and may prompt further screening, action or investigation. If you are sick and need essential supplies, ask someone else to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy to get what you need. If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, make sure to distance yourself from others, particularly vulnerable populations. Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions – including serious heart conditions, chronic lung conditions, including moderate to severe asthma, severe obesity and those who are immunocompromised, including through cancer treatment – might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Statewide testing at standing health facility testing sites require a physician’s order or prescription to be tested (*Bayhealth patients will be pre-screened via phone without needing to see a provider first). These are not walk-in testing sites. Those without a primary care provider can call the DPH Call Center Line at 1-866-408-1899. In New Castle County, individuals can call ChristianaCare at 1-302-733-1000 and Sussex County residents who do not have a provider can call the Beebe COVID-19 Screening Line at 302-645-3200. Individuals awaiting test results, should wait to hear back from their medical provider. The DPH Call Center does not have test results. Additionally, expanded community testing is occurring in Sussex County. These sites do not require a physician’s order. These community testing sites are for community members and employees along the Route 113 corridor in Sussex County, including areas as far west as Seaford/Laurel with a focus on employees of essential businesses, at-risk populations and their families, those exposed to someone with COVID-19, or someone caring for a sick family member with COVID-19. The hours of operation for these sites may be limited by the number of supplies available for the specific event. Anyone with a question about COVID-19, whether related to medical or social service needs, should call Delaware 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, or text your ZIP code to 898-211. Hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. In addition, the Division of Public Health asks any Delaware health care, long-term care, residential, or other high-risk facility with questions or concerns to email: DPH_PAC@delaware.gov or call the DPH Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 and press ext. 2.

"El gobernador Carney declara foco infeccioso de COVID-19 en el condado de Sussex - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Governor John Carney","Wednesday, April 29, 2020","WILMINGTON, Del. – El pasado martes, el gobernador John Carney declaró que el condado de Sussex es un foco de infección (hot spot) de COVID-19 en Delaware y anunció el cronograma inicial para los puestos de pruebas comunitarios de Coordinación y Atención del estado de Delaware. Las pruebas y la asistencia comunitaria tendrán lugar en varias comunidades de Sussex que están en el centro de la epidemia de COVID-19 en Delaware. El gobernador Carney anunció por primera vez la alianza comunitaria para pruebas y asistencia entre el Estado, los sistemas hospitalarios y otras organizaciones la semana pasada, con un foco inicial en el condado de Sussex. El funcionamiento de los puestos de pruebas y asistencia comunitaria se coordinará con la División de Salud Pública de Delaware (DPH), el Departamento de Salud y Servicios Sociales de Delaware (DHSS), los sistemas hospitalarios, los centros de salud con calificación federal (FQHC), organizaciones comunitarias y empleadores del condado de Sussex. El objetivo de las pruebas es llegar principalmente a las siguientes poblaciones de alto riesgo: aquellas con síntomas característicos de COVID-19; las que conviven o trabajan con personas a las que se les diagnosticó COVID-19; familiares o compañeros de casa de personas que trabajan en la industria avícola; y aquellas con afecciones médicas crónicas, como asma, diabetes o hipertensión, y sistemas inmunológicos comprometidos. “El condado de Sussex se ha convertido en un foco de infección de COVID-19, especialmente en áreas a lo largo del corredor de la Ruta 113”, expresó el gobernador John Carney. “Estamos trabajando con miembros de la comunidad para expandir los puestos de pruebas y compartir información educativa en esas comunidades. Es fundamental que usted y su familia se protejan siguiendo los lineamientos de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) y la División de Salud Pública de Delaware. Sobre todo, quédese en casa. Si tiene preguntas, no dude en llamar al 2-1-1 para obtener más información y asistencia. Marque 9-1-1 ante una emergencia. Es fundamental que todos trabajemos juntos para superar esto”. Los residentes del condado de Sussex recibirán alertas de emergencia en sus teléfonos a través de la Agencia de Gestión de Emergencias de Delaware (DEMA) acerca del foco de infección en el condado de Sussex, así como mensajes en colaboración con el Departamento de Educación de Delaware y los distritos escolares locales. Los miembros de la comunidad verán o recibirán materiales educativos impresos en los puestos de pruebas, los servicios de entrega de comida a domicilio existentes, mayor cantidad de carteleras publicitarias, redes sociales y medios publicitarios digitales en todo el condado para reforzar la urgencia del foco de infección de COVID-19 en el condado de Sussex. El estado de Delaware y sus colaboradores testearon a más de 750 personas la semana pasada durante la primera expansión de las pruebas de COVID-19 en comunidades del condado de Sussex. Más del 35% de las pruebas de COVID-19 en los eventos de pruebas comunitarios dieron positivo. A fines de la semana pasada, el gobernador Carney pidió la colaboración de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) en los esfuerzos de testeo comunitario y rastreo de contacto. Los CDC han enviado un equipo de epidemiología a Delaware para ayudar a cuantificar la propagación de la enfermedad en el estado, combatir la crisis de COVID-19 en el condado de Sussex y hacer recomendaciones para prevenir una transmisión aún más generalizada. “Agradecemos profundamente la experiencia y asistencia de los CDC en nuestro esfuerzo por cuantificar y comprender la propagación del COVID-19 en el condado de Sussex”, manifestó el director de la DPH, el Dr. Karyl Rattay. “Este equipo, denominado Epi Aid, abordará el tema desde una perspectiva epidemiológica y trabajará para cuantificar el alcance de la propagación de la enfermedad en Sussex, identificar las vías de transmisión y hacernos recomendaciones para mitigar la propagación”. El objetivo principal de los puestos de pruebas comunitarios es testear a empleados de actividades esenciales, familiares de poblaciones en riesgo y personas expuestas a casos positivos de COVID-19 o a cargo del cuidado de un familiar enfermo con COVID-19. Los puestos de pruebas incluyen pruebas rápidas y de hisopado nasal; investigación inmediata de casos ante resultados positivos; conexión a un coordinador de recursos para brindar alimentos, vivienda y otros servicios a personas infectadas; y kits de cuidado personal a cada persona testeada. Los kits de cuidado personal se entregarán a personas que tengan un alto riesgo de transmisión doméstica y carezcan de los medios para comprar los suministros sin ayuda. No se necesita una orden o remisión médica para estos puestos de pruebas. Cada uno de los sistemas de atención médica en el condado de Sussex está participando en este esfuerzo de testeo comunitario. Habrá personal bilingüe en el lugar. A continuación, se detalla el cronograma inicial de los puestos de pruebas para la comunidad, incluidos los horarios y las sedes en que funcionarán. Nanticoke Memorial Hospital también prevé que comenzará con las pruebas comunitarias durante la semana y dará más información sobre su plan de testeo una vez que se hayan ultimado los detalles.

Esperamos que nuestros colaboradores de atención médica y de la comunidad puedan poner en funcionamiento este modelo de testeos en todo el condado de Sussex y Delaware. Estoy muy orgulloso del Equipo Beebe por desarrollar e implementar nuestro plan tan rápido”. “Bayhealth se enorgullece de que nuestro equipo ayude con las pruebas de COVID-19 en el condado de Sussex, y sostenemos nuestro compromiso de apoyar todos los esfuerzos estatales relacionados con la lucha contra esta pandemia”, manifestó Terry M. Murphy, FACHE, Presidente y Director Ejecutivo de Bayhealth. “Estamos muy orgullosos de nuestra colaboración con la oficina del Gobernador, la División de Salud Pública y nuestros colaboradores de atención médica en todo el estado. Bayhealth continúa prestando servicios a todas las comunidades en el centro y el sur de Delaware a través de nuestra línea directa de control del Equipo de Manejo de Coronavirus y con nuestras pruebas de detección realizadas desde el vehículo a personas remitidas por un proveedor médico, y seguimos brindando atención a quienes la necesitan. El plan de Bayhealth para manejar el coronavirus en la comunidad ha demostrado ser un sistema muy efectivo con un promedio de 450 personas testeadas semanalmente y un total de 2,700 testeadas hasta la fecha”. “Nanticoke Memorial Hospital y Peninsula Regional Health System mantienen un compromiso con nuestra comunidad y contribuyen con el testeo de la población en el estado de Delaware”, expresó Penny Short, MSM, BSN, RN, Presidenta de Nanticoke Memorial Hospital y Vicepresidenta Principal de Peninsula Regional Health System. “Nos complace trabajar junto con la División de Salud Pública y nuestros líderes locales para desarrollar puestos de pruebas que satisfagan las necesidades de nuestra población”. “La Comisión Hispana de Delaware quiere agradecer el liderazgo del gobernador y su personal al identificar las necesidades inmediatas relacionadas con el COVID-19, específicamente en el condado de Sussex, donde ha tenido un gran impacto en la comunidad latina”, dijo el Presidente de la Comisión Hispana de Delaware, Javier G. Torrijos. “Estos sitios de atención comunitaria son importantes para brindar de inmediato la información y los recursos que ayudan a reducir la pandemia en nuestra comunidad. Sin los recursos y el material educativo multilingüe, el impacto del COVID-19 sería mucho peor”. “Los sistemas de salud y servicios sociales del estado de Delaware, los sistemas locales de atención médica, los proveedores privados de atención médica y las organizaciones sin fines de lucro locales se están uniendo en un esfuerzo coordinado por llegar a todos los rincones del condado de Sussex y promover conductas de protección entre sus residentes, en particular entre la comunidad hispana”, comentó Jennifer Fuqua, PhD, Directora Ejecutiva de La Esperanza. “La Esperanza ha descubierto que muchos miembros de nuestra comunidad están sobrellevando muy bien esta crisis, dentro de lo esperado, pero que otros la están pasando muy mal por falta de acceso a proveedores de atención médica primaria y necesidades básicas insatisfechas. Los sitios de atención médica comunitaria que el Estado pondrá a disposición esta semana en Milford, Georgetown, Seaford y Millsboro deberían ayudar mucho a informar a nuestra comunidad sobre las conductas de protección, realizar controles y seguimiento de atención médica, conectar a las personas con los servicios sociales y calmar los temores justificados que la gente ha expresado”.   Haga clic aquí para acceder a archivos PDF y gráficos compartibles.

Other symptoms such as headache or digestive symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or lack of appetite) have been identified as potential symptoms related to COVID-19 and may prompt further screening, action or investigation. If you are sick and need essential supplies, ask someone else to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy to get what you need. If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, make sure to distance yourself from others, particularly vulnerable populations. Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions – including serious heart conditions, chronic lung conditions, including moderate to severe asthma, severe obesity and those who are immunocompromised, including through cancer treatment – might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

"Governor Carney Declares COVID-19 Hot Spot in Sussex County, Announces Expansion of Community Testing Sites - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Tuesday, April 28, 2020","Governor Carney Declares COVID-19 Hot Spot in Sussex County, Announces Expansion of  Community Testing Sites   WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Tuesday declared Sussex County a hot spot for COVID-19 in Delaware and announced the initial schedule for the State of Delaware’s Coordination and Care community testing sites. Testing and outreach will occur in several Sussex communities that are at the center of Delaware’s COVID-19 epidemic. Governor Carney first announced the community testing and outreach partnership among the state, hospital systems, and others last week, with an initial focus on Sussex County.   The testing sites and outreach will be conducted in coordination with the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), hospital systems, Federally Qualified Health Centers, community organizations, and Sussex County employers. Testing is geared to reach the following high-risk populations: those with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, those living or working with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, family members or housemates of those working in the poultry industry, and those with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension, or compromised immune systems.   “Sussex County has become a hot spot for COVID-19, especially in areas along the Route 113 corridor,” said Governor John Carney. “We are working with community partners to expand testing sites and share educational information in those communities. It’s critical to protect your family and yourself by following the guidance from the CDC and the Delaware Division of Public Health. Most importantly, stay home. If you have questions, don’t be afraid to call 2-1-1 for more information and assistance. Dial 9-1-1 for an emergency. It’s critical we all work together to get through this.”   Residents of Sussex County will receive emergency alerts on their phones through the Delaware Emergency Management Agency about the hot spot in Sussex County, as well as messages in partnership with the Delaware Department of Education and local school districts. Community members will see printed educational materials at testing sites and within existing food delivery services, increased billboard placements, and social media and digital advertising across the county stressing the urgency of the COVID-19 hotspot in Sussex County.    The State of Delaware and its partners tested more than 750 individuals last week during the first expansion of COVID-19 community testing in Sussex County. More than 35% of test results at the community testing events were positive for COVID-19.   Late last week, Governor Carney requested assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist in community testing and contact tracing efforts. The CDC has sent an epidemiology team to Delaware to help quantify the spread of the disease downstate, combat the COVID-19 crisis in Sussex County, and make recommendations to prevent even more widespread transmission.   “We are incredibly grateful for the CDC’s expertise, and assistance as we work to quantify and understand the spread of COVID-19 in Sussex County,” said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. “This Epi Aid team will approach the issue from an epidemiological perspective and work to quantify the extent of the spread of the disease in Sussex, identify the transmission routes and provide recommendations for us to consider in mitigating the spread.”   The focus of community testing sites is employees of essential businesses, family members of at-risk populations, those exposed to someone with COVID-19, or someone caring for a sick family member with COVID-19. The testing sites involve both rapid and nasal swab testing, immediate case investigation for positive cases, connection to a resource coordinator for services like food and housing for those who are positive, and care kits to be given to individuals being tested. Care kits will be given to people who have a high risk of household transmission and do not have the means to purchase the supplies themselves. A doctor’s order or referral is not needed for these sites.    Each of the health care systems in Sussex County is participating in this community testing effort. There will be bilingual staff on site. The timing and locations of initially scheduled community testing sites are below. Nanticoke Memorial Hospital also anticipates beginning community testing within the week and will provide details for their testing plan once details have been finalized.   Community Testing Site hosted by Beebe Healthcare in the parking lot between JD Shuckers and the Veteran’s Administration off of Rt. 404 in Georgetown: Wednesday, April 29 from 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. Community Testing Site hosted by Bayhealth at the DHSS State Services Center in Milford located at 253 NE Front Street: Thursday, April 30 from 9:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. Community Testing Site hosted by Beebe Healthcare in the parking lot between JD Shuckers and the Veteran’s Administration off of Rt. 404 in Georgetown: Friday, May 1 from 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. Community Testing Site hosted by Bayhealth at the DHSS State Services Center in Milford located at 253 NE Front Street: Saturday, May 2 from 9:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. Community Testing Site hosted by Beebe Healthcare in the parking lot between JD Shuckers and the Veteran’s Administration off of Rt. 404 in Georgetown: Saturday, May 2 from 9 a.m. – 1 p.m. Community Testing Site hosted by Bayhealth at the DHSS State Services Center in Milford located at 253 NE Front Street: Monday, May 4 from 9:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m.    “Beebe Healthcare is committed to work with Governor Carney to develop a model for statewide testing that aligns the efforts of investigating the extent of the COVID-19 infection with the best clinical care for our population,” said Dr. David Tam, President and CEO of Beebe Healthcare. “We have led the effort to operationalize the State’s plan for community-based testing in Georgetown that brings together many different healthcare and community organizations to provide a safe and accessible way people can be screened, tested, and receive the social support and education needed to help decrease further spread of the COVID-19 virus.  It is our hope that this testing model can be operationalized throughout Sussex County and Delaware by our healthcare and community partners.  I am so proud of Team Beebe for developing and implementing our plan so quickly.”   “Bayhealth is proud to have our team assisting with the COVID-19 testing in Sussex County, and we remain committed to supporting all statewide efforts related to fighting this pandemic,” said Terry M. Murphy, FACHE, Bayhealth President and CEO. “We are very proud of our collaboration with the Governor’s office, the Division of Public Health, and our healthcare partners throughout the state. Bayhealth continues to serve all of our communities in central and southern Delaware through our Coronavirus Management Team screening hotline and with our referral-based drive-thru screenings, and by providing care to those who need it. Bayhealth’s community coronavirus management plan has proven a very effective system with an average of 450 people tested weekly for a total of 2,700 tested to date.”   “Nanticoke Memorial Hospital and Peninsula Regional Health System are committed to our community and support statewide testing in Delaware,” said Penny Short, MSM, BSN, RN, President Nanticoke Memorial Hospital, Senior Vice President Peninsula Regional Health System. “We are pleased to work alongside both the Division of Public Health and our local leaders to develop testing sites to meet the needs of our population.”   “The Delaware Hispanic Commission wants to thank the leadership of the governor and his staff for identifying the immediate needs related to COVID-19, specifically in Sussex County where it has impacted the Latino community,” said Delaware Hispanic Commission Chairman Javier G. Torrijos. “These community care sites are important to provide the education and resources immediately to help curve the pandemic in our community. Without the resources and the multilingual education material, the impact of COVID-19 would be much worse.”   “The State of Delaware health and social service systems, local healthcare systems, private healthcare providers and local nonprofits are coming together in a coordinated effort to reach out and promote protective behaviors in Sussex County for all, but in particular for the Hispanic community,” said Jennifer Fuqua, PhD, Executive Director, La Esperanza. “La Esperanza has found that many in our community are faring as well as could be expected during this crisis, but that some are truly struggling with lack of access to a primary healthcare provider and basic needs. The community healthcare sites that the State is setting up this week in Milford, Georgetown, Seaford and Millsboro should help a great deal in educating our community about protective behaviors, providing screening and healthcare follow up, connecting people to social services, and alleviating the very real fears that people have been expressing.”   Click here for sharable PDFs and graphics.    Delawareans with questions about COVID-19, related to medical or social service needs, should call 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

If you are sick with any of the following symptoms, stay home: fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle fatigue, or digestive symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or lack of appetite. If you are sick and need essential supplies, ask someone else to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy to get what you need. If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, make sure to distance yourself from others, particularly vulnerable populations. Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions – including serious heart conditions, chronic lung conditions, including moderate to severe asthma, severe obesity and those who are immunocompromised, including through cancer treatment – might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Statewide testing at standing health facility testing sites require a physician’s order or prescription to be tested (*Bayhealth patients will be pre-screened via phone without needing to see a provider first).

Apati madi 28 avril, a 8:00 a.m. Delawareans yo ap oblije kouvri figi yo nan plas piblik, ki gen ladan boutik, magazen, famasi, biwo medikal ak transpò piblik yo. Nou ap fè fas a yon sitiyasyon ki grav anpil, ak lòt ka COVID-19 ak ospitalizasyon nan tout eta a. Se syans k ap gide tout aksyon nou yo  ak vize sove lavi moun. Li enpòtan pou kouvri figi w nan plas piblik yo pou ka anpeche transmisyon maladi sa a. Men, kouvri figi w se pa pou pèmèt ou ale an piblik pi souvan. Delawaryen yo ta dwe rete lakay yo sòf si li absoliman nesesè pou yo ale deyò pou travay esansyèl oswa atik esansyèl. Pa ale an piblik san nesesite . Ou pral sèlman ogmante risk ou – ak risk pou fanmi ou, zanmi ak vwazen. Vandredi 1ye Me a 8:00 a.m., konpayi yo dwe pran tou sèten mezi pou kenbe anplwaye ak kliyan yo an sekirite: Mande pou anplwaye yo kouvri figi yo lè y ap travay nan zòn ki ouvri pou piblik la ak nan zòn kote li posib pou yo rive kanpe nan 6 pye ak lòt anplwaye yo.  Bay anplwaye yo mask ak dezenfektan pou men yo sou depans konpayi an. Refize moun ki pa kouvri figi yo antre – oswa si pa ta gen youn ki disponib pou yo. Si yon konpayi refize antre bay medikaman, founiti medikal oswa manje, konpayi an dwe bay lòt metòd pou yo vin chèche oswa pou livrezon.  Mwen ankouraje Delawaryen pou yo sèvi ak mask twal epi rezève mask medikal klas (tankou N95, KN95 ak mask chirijikal) pou travayè swen sante ak premye sekouris yo.

La situación que enfrentamos es muy grave, con nuevos casos de COVID-19 y hospitalizaciones en todo el estado. Todas nuestras medidas se apoyan en la ciencia y pretenden salvar vidas. El uso de una mascarilla en lugares públicos es importante para evitar la transmisión de esta enfermedad. Sin embargo, el uso de una mascarilla no es un permiso para salir de casa más a menudo. Los residentes de Delaware deben quedarse en sus hogares a menos que su salida sea absolutamente necesaria para trabajar en una actividad esencial u obtener artículos esenciales. No salga a espacios públicos si no es necesario. Solo aumentará su riesgo y el de sus familiares, amigos y vecinos. Para las 8:00 a. m. del viernes, 1.° de mayo, las empresas y los comercios también deberán tomar ciertas medidas para preservar la seguridad de sus empleados y clientes:  Deberán exigir a los empleados que usen mascarilla para trabajar en espacios abiertos al público y en áreas donde sea probable que estén a una distancia de 6 pies o menos de otros miembros del personal. Serán responsables de brindar, a cargo de la empresa, mascarillas y desinfectante para manos a sus empleados. Deberán prohibir el ingreso a personas por no usar mascarilla (o no tener ninguna para darles). Si la empresa que prohíbe el ingreso provee medicamentos, insumos médicos o alimentos, deberá ofrecer métodos alternativos para la entrega de productos a domicilio o en la tienda.  Les pido encarecidamente a los residentes de Delaware que usen mascarillas de tela y reserven las mascarillas de uso médico (como las mascarillas N95, KN95 y quirúrgicas) para los profesionales de la salud y el personal de primera respuesta.

"Governor Carney Requires Delawareans to Wear Face Coverings in Public Settings - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Saturday, April 25, 2020","Children 2-years-old and younger should not wear face coverings due to suffocation risk WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Saturday issued the thirteenth modification to his State of Emergency declaration, requiring Delawareans to wear face coverings in public settings, including in grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, doctor’s offices, and on public transportation. Governor Carney’s order does not require children aged 12 or younger to wear a face covering. Any child 2-years-old or younger MUST NOT wear a face covering, due to the risk of suffocation. Read Governor Carney’s modified order, which is effective 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 28. Click here for resources about face coverings. “Now is not the time for Delawareans to get complacent,” said Governor Carney. “We face a very serious situation, with additional cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations statewide. All of our actions are guided by science, and intended to save lives. Wearing a face covering in public settings is important to prevent transmission of this disease. But wearing a face covering is not permission to go out in public more often. Delawareans should stay home unless it’s absolutely necessary to go out for essential work or essential items. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. You will only increase your risk – and the risk to your family, friends, and neighbors.” Under Governor Carney’s modified order, businesses must also take certain steps to keep their employees and customers safe. By 8:00 a.m. on Friday, May 1, businesses must:  Require employees to wear a face covering while working in areas open to the public and in areas where coming within 6 feet of other staff is likely. Provide, at the business’ expense, face coverings and hand sanitizer for their employees. Deny entry to individuals who do not have a face covering – or if one is not available for them. If any business denying entry is providing medication, medical supplies, or food, the business must provide alternate methods of pickup or delivery.  Delawareans are urged to use cloth face coverings and reserve medical-grade masks for use by health care workers and first responders. Medical-grade masks include N95, KN95, surgical, or other masks that would be appropriate for a health care setting. Delawareans wearing a face covering should practice strict hand-washing before and after touching the face covering, according to the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH). Face coverings are not a replacement for washing hands, practicing physical distancing, and staying home. Delawareans who are sick should wear a face covering over their nose and mouth if they must be around other people – even while at home. “Wearing a face covering is not a substitute for existing guidance around hand-washing and social distancing,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, Director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. “Delawareans should stay at home whenever possible, only leaving for essential activities. Wash your hands. Keep 6-10 feet between yourself and others.” Governor Carney’s State of Emergency has the full force and effect of law. The stay-at-home order, and mandatory quarantine for out-of-state travelers, remain in place. Violations of the emergency order, or any of its modifications, constitute a criminal offense. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19, related to medical or social service needs, should call 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekends. Questions may also be submitted by email at DPHCall@delaware.gov.

"Top federal and state prosecutors form Delaware COVID-19 anti-fraud coalition - State of Delaware News","Captive","Captive Insurance","Department of Justice","Friday, April 24, 2020","Today, United States Attorney David C. Weiss and Delaware Attorney General Kathleen Jennings announced the formation of a new Coronavirus (COVID-19) Anti-Fraud Coalition, aimed at better protecting the citizens of Delaware from criminal and civil fraud arising from the pandemic. The Coalition is comprised of local, state and federal agencies, investigators and prosecutors with significant experience in handling complaints and cases related to consumer fraud, financial fraud, heath care fraud, and cybercrime.  Together, the Coalition will share information and resources to monitor, identify and investigate misconduct to protect the people of Delaware from those exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic for their own advantage. Agencies participating in the Coalition include:  Delaware Department of Justice United States Attorney’s Office Federal Bureau of Investigation U.S. Department of Homeland Security-Homeland Security Investigations U.S. Small Business Administration-Office of Inspector General U.S. Department of Labor-Office of Inspector General Delaware Department of Health & Social Services Delaware Office of Management & Budget Delaware Department of Transportation Delaware Department of Education Delaware Department of Insurance Delaware Department of Finance Delaware Department of Labor Delaware Auditor of Accounts Delaware State Police New Castle County  Participating agencies will take information, tips and complaints from the public, as well as other local law enforcement agencies seeking the Coalition’s assistance. “This pandemic is ripe for exploitation by scammers,” said Attorney General Jennings. “The Delaware Department of Justice and its Fraud Division works each day to educate consumers, prevent fraud, and bring scammers to justice—but our work will never be done as long as consumers continue to be preyed upon by those who profit shamelessly off of their fears and anxiety. Our collaboration with the U.S. Attorney’s Office is the latest chapter in a longstanding record of partnership, and in this public health and economic crisis it has never been more important for everyone at the federal, state, and local level to collaborate on the people’s behalf.” “Sadly, criminals look to take advantage of people, regardless of the circumstances,” said David C. Weiss, U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware.  “But the people of Delaware can rest assured that we will be relentless in bringing to justice those seeking to illegally profit from this crisis. If you believe you are the victim of a scam, or have been contacted by someone falsely claiming to be a representative of the government, please contact the Coalition at one of the below email addresses immediately.  I want to thank our local and state partners for their commitment to combating fraud and protecting Delawareans.  By working together, we are more fully able to identify, investigate, and prosecute these criminal acts of fraud related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In these challenging times, I am grateful for this type of collaboration, which represents the best of public service.” Be on the lookout for and be wary of potential COVID-19 scams and abuses. Any information, complaints, or concerns can be reported to the Coalition by email to COVID.DOJ@delaware.gov or USADE-COVIDFRAUD@usdoj.gov. Delawareans who may have been scammed can also reach out to the Attorney General’s consumer protection hotline at (800) 220-5424. In addition, you can also contact the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) by hotline (866-720-5721) or to the NCDF e-mail address disaster@leo.gov. Common scams and frauds include:  Economic Impact Payment (Stimulus Check):  Scammers pretend to be government officials offering false economic impact payments (stimulus checks) in order to obtain personal identifying information including social security and bank account numbers. Diagnosis Testing Scams: Scammers offer fake COVID-19 testing kits, particularly door-to-door. Treatment/Cure Scams: Scammers offer fake or unproven treatment regimens that are particularly dangerous because they have the potential to do more harm than good. Charity Scams: Virtually every time there is a disaster or emergency, scammers set up fake charities to solicit donations that they then spend on themselves. Overinflated prices: The Coalition will use every tool available to hold sellers accountable who unlawfully use the COVID-19 pandemic to unreasonably inflate prices. Investment Scams: Scammers make false claims about tests, cures and other matters related to COVID-19 in order to entice victims to make investment decisions based on those false claims that allow the scammer to steal money and assets from Delawareans. Cyber Scams: Scammers send victims emails related to COVID-19 that appear to be from the victims’ banks, health care providers, the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and others for the purpose of obtaining the victims’ personal identifying information and exploiting it for the scammers’ own benefit. App Scams: Scammers are creating and manipulating mobile apps designed to track the spread of COVID-19 to insert malware that will compromise users’ devices and personal information. Insurance, Workers’ Compensation and Medicaid Fraud: Businesses and government agencies are not immune to scams. They should also be vigilant to ensure scammers do not take advantage of their businesses or customers during this pandemic. Scams specifically targeted at seniors: Seniors are more vulnerable than ever to common scams like the Grandparent Scam and Government Imposter Scams.  Consumers receiving a call or any contact claiming that loved ones are in danger or hurt, that they owe money and failure to pay will result in their arrest or other harm, or that their benefits are in jeopardy, do not act. Contact your loved ones or the purported agency using known, trusted contact information not sourced from the suspicious communication."

"Governor Carney Removes Restrictions on Out-of-State Health Care Workers to Assist in COVID-19 Response - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Thursday, April 23, 2020","Twelfth modification allows the Public Health Authority to activate additional workers WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Thursday issued the twelfth modification to his State of Emergency declaration, which will allow the Public Health Authority to activate more out-of-state health care workers to assist in Delaware’s fight against COVID-19.        Read Governor Carney’s updated State of Emergency. Subject to certain restrictions, the modified declaration allows individuals who previously held a license to practice medicine in any United States jurisdiction, to provide health care services on a volunteer basis in Delaware when authorized by the Public Health Authority. The provider must be appropriately trained, and their license must have been in good standing for a five-year period before it expired or lapsed. The modification also limits restrictions on pharmacists, respiratory therapists, physician assistants, paramedics, emergency medical technician, and nurses, allowing them to assist in Delaware’s response to COVID-19 under all the same conditions. Out-of-state providers must register with the Medical Reserve Corps to volunteer in Delaware. “Delaware’s fight against COVID-19 is far from over,” said Governor Carney. “We owe a real debt of gratitude to our front line health care workers and emergency responders. They have been risking their own health and safety to protect Delawareans and save lives. This updated declaration will allow even more health care workers to assist in Delaware’s response. Our message for Delawareans remains the same. Stay home unless you need to go out for essential work or an essential items like groceries, or a prescription. Going out in public unnecessarily not only increases your risk, but it increases the risk for your family, friends, and neighbors. We’ll get through this by working together.” The modification Governor Carney signed on Thursday afternoon also facilitates the issuance of marriage licenses by allowing the parties to communicate by video conference. And it allows state agencies and members of the public additional time to consider rules and regulations, giving agencies discretion to extend public comment periods for 30 days from the date the State of Emergency is rescinded. Governor Carney’s State of Emergency has the full force and effect of law. The stay-at-home order, and mandatory quarantine for out-of-state travelers, remain in place. Violations of the emergency order, or any of its modifications, constitute a criminal offense. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19, related to medical or social service needs, should call 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

"Governor Carney Announces Public Engagement Around Economic Reopening, Recovery - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Thursday, April 23, 2020","WILMINGTON, Del. — Governor John Carney on Thursday announced a statewide public engagement strategy focused on Delaware’s economic reopening and recovery effort due to COVID-19.  Visit de.gov/economy to learn more and to help shape Delaware’s economic recovery effort. Starting on Monday, the Delaware Division of Small Business and the Delaware Prosperity Partnership will host virtual Recovery Town Halls with members of the General Assembly, small businesses, and local Chambers of Commerce, to begin collecting feedback from small business leaders about Delaware’s economic reopening.   Small Business Recovery Town Hall – Monday, April 27 – 2:00 p.m. – Eastern Sussex  Small Business Recovery Town Hall – Tuesday, April 28 – 6:00 p.m. – Southern New Castle  Small Business Recovery Town Hall – Thursday, April 30 – 10:00 a.m. – Western Sussex  Small Business Recovery Town Hall  – Thursday, April 30 – 6:00 p.m. – Western New Castle County Small Business Recovery Town Hall – Monday, May 4 – 2:00 p.m. – Kent County  Small Business Recovery Town Hall – Tuesday, May 5 – 6:00 p.m. – Wilmington Area  Small Business Recovery Town Hall – Wednesday, May 6 – 6:00 p.m. – Northern New Castle County   Lieutenant Governor Hall-Long will host similar, virtual town hall meetings with members of the public to collect feedback that will inform Delaware’s recovery effort.   Recovery Town Hall – Wednesday, April 29 – 6:00 p.m. – Kent County  Recovery Town Hall – Monday, May 4 – 6:00 p.m. – Northern New Castle County Recovery Town Hall – Wednesday, May 6 – 7:30 p.m. – Sussex County  Recovery Town Hall – Thursday, May 7 – 6:00 p.m. – Southern New Castle County    MEDIA: Reporters interested in covering the Recovery Town Halls should RSVP directly to jessica.borcky@delaware.gov with the meetings you would like to attend.  Additionally, Governor Carney has assigned S.W.A.T. teams from state government to work with industries most hard-hit by the COVID-19 crisis, including the restaurant industry, tourism, retail, and the arts community.  “We’re still seeing increased infections of COVID-19, so this fight is far from over,” said Governor Carney. “At the same time, we need to look forward. We need to plan for safely reopening our economy under a new normal. I encourage all Delawareans and Delaware small businesses to lean into this process. Visit de.gov/economy to learn more about Delaware’s plan, and to offer ideas on how to safely restart our economy. Help get Delaware through this difficult time. Most importantly, continue to stay home. Stay safe. And stay informed.” “To successfully reopen will require all communities and sectors of our economy to participate,” said Lieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long. “I look forward to hearing from Delawareans and gathering their recommendations to keep people safe, and able to return to work, and make our state stronger and healthier.” “While any effort to reopen our state has to be driven by science, we also have to begin the process of mapping out how to restart our economy in a smart, safe manner. Getting input from all corners of our state is an important part of that process,” said House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf. “Having our business leaders at the table will ensure that their voices are heard and their thoughts, ideas and concerns are taken into account as we move forward through this challenging time.” “I am glad the administration is seeking out the input of small business operators and that these meetings are starting quickly,” said House Minority Leader Danny Short. “We need a plan to put Delawareans back to work as soon as possible.” “Our small business community is being hit hard by this public health crisis and they need our support more than ever,” said Senate President Pro Tempore David McBride. “I’ve spent hours talking to business owners in my district who are facing incredible challenges that are impacting them and their workers. I’m hopeful these virtual town halls will give us an opportunity to learn from their struggles and ensure we are attentive to their concerns as we plan to reopen our state and address the economic recovery ahead.” “This pandemic has had a terrible impact on our small business community. Given the seasonal nature of the economy here in eastern Sussex County, a lot is on the line over the coming weeks and months,” said Senate Minority Leader Gerald Hocker. “I look forward to joining with the Governor and my fellow legislators to hear directly from local business owners and to plot a course forward for all Delawareans.”  “This is an important first step in getting our economy restarted,” said Damian DeStefano, Director of the Division of Small Business. “The Governor’s plan to address the complex task of reopening by focusing on customized plans for individual industries is the right approach to determine how to safely and effectively do so. We look forward to helping in this effort.” “To safely and successfully reopen businesses throughout Delaware requires us to listen to the experiences, ideas and opportunities employers and businesses have. Hearing directly from CEOs, owners and site and operations leaders will not only help us to have a successful Phase 1 launch, but may also lead to new opportunities,” said Kurt Foreman, President & CEO of Delaware Prosperity Partnership.    SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY TOWN HALL – EASTERN SUSSEX WHAT:         The Delaware Division of Small Business and the Delaware Prosperity Partnership will collect feedback from small business leaders and members of the public about Delaware’s economic reopening. Delaware businesses interested in participating should contact their local legislator.    WHO:             Lt.

"Governor Carney Partners with Health Providers and Sussex Employers on Community Testing Sites, Outreach, Education - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Wednesday, April 22, 2020","WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Wednesday announced a partnership with the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, the Delaware Department of Agriculture, Westside Family Healthcare, local hospital systems, poultry industry employers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and trusted community partners to stand up community testing sites in Sussex County, and increase outreach and distribution of educational materials about COVID-19 in southern Delaware. “We’ve seen a significant surge in COVID-19 cases in communities across Sussex County,” said Governor John Carney. “This new testing program is designed to save lives. Over the next week, we will be partnering with local hospitals, the Delaware Division of Public Health, the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, and the Delaware Department of Agriculture, and others to offer free, rapid coronavirus testing at community testing sites in Sussex County. As the largest employers in Sussex County, we are partnering with the poultry industry to ensure that workers and their families get all of the information they need to be safe and healthy.” The community testing plan is a three-pronged effort. It includes testing through the use of rapid test kits and ensuring access to care; guidance on isolation and assistance when it is not possible to isolate safely; and education and outreach through the assistance of trusted community partners. Individuals will receive “care kits” with essential materials including hand sanitizer, bandanas, thermometers, and educational materials. Educational materials are being translated into Spanish and Haitian Creole to reach those who do not read English as their first language. These tests are not mandatory. “We are grateful for the partnership of everyone involved in bringing this massive effort together,” said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. “In addition to testing sites at poultry plants, there will also be community testing sites, which we expect will reach workers in other industries and their families. We believe this community-based testing strategy will be critical in identifying the extent of the spread of COVID-19 and of mitigating it, by providing guidance and support for those with positive test results and educational materials for everyone tested.” “The efforts of all these partners to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our rural communities here in Sussex County is a testament to working towards a common goal to re-open our state. From the farmers to the workers in the plants to employees in agribusinesses, our workforce is the backbone that makes agriculture so successful in Delaware,” said Secretary of Agriculture Michael T. Scuse. “We want to ensure that every employee gets the care they need, and to make sure if a staff member does have COVID-19 that we can stop it from spreading to others. We appreciate the efforts that the poultry companies are taking to protect their employees, including implementing physical barriers and social distancing protocols, daily health screenings, and now on-site testing.” Partners in the community testing efforts include:   Bayhealth Beebe Healthcare ChristianaCare  Nanticoke Health Services Westside Family Healthcare Allen Harim Mountaire Farms Perdue Farms Local Community Partners and Organizations Municipal and County Government Delaware Technical Community College Georgetown Community Health Centers and Providers   Governor Carney, DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay, and DEMA Director A.J. Schall will discuss the community testing and outreach partnership during their 1:45 p.m. press briefing on Friday.

"Preventing Child Abuse, Raising Awareness During COVID-19 - State of Delaware News","News","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","","Tuesday, April 21, 2020","WILMINGTON – During this COVID-19 public health emergency, when there are changes to families’ support systems and an increased risk of isolation, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families (DSCYF), is raising awareness of how to prevent, recognize and report child abuse and neglect. Historically, April is recognized as Child Abuse Prevention Month and this year our mission is even more critical to protect and support strong, safe and resilient families. “Families are under immense pressure and stress at this time. In addition to trying to protect their family during an unprecedented public health emergency, they have financial, educational and emotional issues to navigate that have been exacerbated by this pandemic. It’s on all of us to make sure they have the resources they need to weather this very trying time,” said Josette Manning, Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families. “I’m proud of the work of our Department and their dedication to Delaware families. They are working tirelessly – and creatively – to find ways to connect with families and make sure that they are supported and safe, and feel empowered. We can prevent child abuse and neglect by ensuring families have what they need to be successful.  Anyone can call our child abuse and neglect hotline at 1-800-292-9582 or report online at iseethesigns.org 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We are here to provide support when families need it.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 1 in 7 children have experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year. During crisis situations such as this one, which has upended routines, reduced our physical connections, closed schools and workplaces, and halted activities, experts say it is important to foster support for families and encourage stress-reducing behaviors. “The month of April marks Child Abuse Prevention Month, and serves as a reminder that every Delawarean has a role in preventing child abuse,” said Governor John Carney. “While we are socially distancing and staying in our homes, it’s important for us to recognize that there are many children in our state who don’t feel comfortable in theirs. Please remember there is always a support network just one call or e-mail away, and share resources with those who may need them during this uncertain time. Thank you to all of the professionals who work tirelessly on this issue this month, and every month, in order to keep our children safe.” DSCYF, commonly known as the Delaware Children’s Department, has made key changes to adapt to the COVID-19 crisis and continue to support the resiliency of families. To that end, DSCYF’s Division of Family Services continues to meet with families and make connections, but now they utilize technology to do more virtual check-ins. They continue to make necessary home visits, but do so while taking precautions to protect themselves and the families we serve. A key to preventing child abuse is ensuring that families feel empowered and supported. DSCYF’s Division of Prevention and Behavioral Health Services, is also creatively connecting families to needed services during this time. For example, Family Crisis Therapists (FCTs) are utilizing virtual check-ins, connecting parents to resources like how to find rental assistance and unemployment benefits, making referrals to health services and delivering meals and other supplies. Our contracted Behavioral Health Consultant Program is coordinating wellness checks, participating in online school meetings and classes and providing prevention, early intervention, and therapeutic services for students and families. Additional initiatives include the Promoting Safe and Stable Family Program, contracted in the community statewide, which is working to address long-term needs beyond the pandemic by helping families address some of the root causes of family stress, like financial trouble. The Fatherhood Initiative has provided virtual parenting education sessions and meetings, and is looking to provide and support virtual family game, meal and movie nights to foster connections. Another needed resource, Delaware Project LAUNCH – supporting families in the city of Wilmington – has initiated Connections Cafés utilizing Zoom to provide support, effective coping techniques, self-care tips and hands-on activities for both caregivers and their young children to address issues related to anxiety, stress, social isolation and relationship building. “During Child Abuse Prevention Month, it is important to remember that we all have a role to play in keeping children safe. While maintaining a safe physical distance is critical right now, providing social support and maintaining connections with family and friends virtually is a great way to reduce stress and feelings of isolation that can lead to child maltreatment,” said Karen DeRasmo, Executive Director of Prevent Child Abuse Delaware.  Delawareans can utilize DSCYF’s online portal – iseethesigns.org – to submit online reports of suspected child abuse and neglect. Reporting online is simple: individuals can access iseethesigns.org on any mobile device or desktop computer. Individuals can always call the child abuse and neglect hotline 1-800-292-9582 to make a report of child abuse or neglect. These services are available 24/7, and reporters can choose to remain anonymous. Together, we can make a difference in a child’s life.   Additional Resources for Families Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting – call 1-800-292-9582 or go to iseethesigns.org Child Response Priority Hotline (mental health crisis help): 1-800-969-4357 Crisis Text Line for Youth: Text DE to 741-741 Prevent Child Abuse Delaware Beau Biden Foundation Nemours Kids Health   Media Contact: Jen Rini, jen.rini@delaware.gov"

"DOL Releases Guidance for Independent Contractors and Self-employed Seeking Unemployment Through the CARES Act - State of Delaware News","Department of Labor","","","Thursday, April 16, 2020","[WILMINGTON, DE] THURSDAY APRIL 16, 2020 – The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act recently passed by the United States Congress and signed into law on March 27th provides unemployment assistance to independent contractors and those self-employed who have been affected by the Coronavirus. Most state’s unemployment systems determine eligibility and process payments for workers whose wages are reported by their employers and verified through the Division of Unemployment Insurance (DUI). In order to begin processing claims for this new category of eligible individuals and prevent fraud, abuse and identity theft, the Federal US Department of Labor requires that states design new systems to pay benefits to independent contractors/self-employed and ensure the validity of their claims. Delaware Department of Labor (DOL) is currently working with a vendor to design and test new technologies that will integrate with our existing benefits claims system. This technology will allow the Division of Unemployment Insurance (DUI) to verify earnings reported to the IRS and determine the eligibility of independent contractors and the self-employed to apply for benefits under the (CARES) Act. We anticipate that these workers will be able to apply through this new system within 3-6 weeks. We will provide more details regarding implementation and how to apply on our website next week. “The hardship that the coronavirus pandemic has placed on Delaware workers is unprecedented. These workers will receive the much-needed assistance provided to them under the CARES Act. We are working around the clock to make that happen; Hopefully, ahead of schedule” said Cerron Cade, Secretary of the Delaware Department of Labor. Once the system is ready to receive applications from those who are self-employed or are independent contractors, DOL will require specific documentation available at the time you submit your application online. The documents you will need are as follows:  Driver license or State issued Identification Your last year’s income tax statement or quarterly earnings statement State of Delaware Business License number Current bank account number and routing number  To date, DOL has processed and paid 70% of initial claims for benefits submitted to their offices since March 1st and is currently paying more than $30 million in benefits to affected workers each week. The agency has received more than 60,000 claims in 4 weeks; nearly double the total number of claims received in 2019.

The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control will host a virtual event through the end of the month for Delawareans to celebrate the natural world, engage in environmental education and contribute to a resolve for sustainable change. While annual volunteer clean-up events and other community activities have been canceled this year, the Earth Day 2020 Scavenger Hunt and Pledge focuses on how to take care of the planet. Beginning today, look for daily questions posted on Facebook, search for clues on DNREC’s website, and reply to the original post with answers. Participants will be challenged by a range of questions related to climate change, recycling, state parks and more. Winners will be selected randomly each day for prizes, including Delaware State Parks passes and eco-friendly products. Delawareans are also invited to enjoy special interactive home-based activities and post selfies on facebook.com/DNREC to be eligible for random prize drawings. Everyone is encouraged to take the online pledge to adopt activities with a positive environmental impact, not just for Earth Day, but all year long. “At DNREC, we make every day Earth Day – working to build a cleaner and healthier Delaware,” said Secretary Shawn Garvin. “There is no more timely opportunity than the 50th anniversary of Earth Day for Delawareans to join us and other people around the globe to promote the conservation of our planet.” The first Earth Day in 1970 was a coast-to-coast celebration and movement to mobilize an emerging public consciousness about pollution. Earth Day led to passage of landmark environmental laws in the United States, including the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. In Delaware at that time, the General Assembly had made a commitment to preserving and protecting the environment by passing a bill in 1969 to create a new state agency that would soon become DNREC. Now in its 50th year, DNREC offers programs that support cleaner transportation, energy conservation, renewable energy, recycling and more. About DNREC The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control protects and manages the state’s natural resources, protects public health, provides outdoor recreational opportunities and educates Delawareans about the environment.

"Governor Carney Requires Stricter Measures in Long-Term Care Facilities to Fight COVID-19 - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","News","Office of the Governor","Wednesday, April 15, 2020","Updated emergency order seeks to protect residents, workers in nursing facilities WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Wednesday issued the eleventh modification to his State of Emergency declaration, requiring stricter guidelines to prevent COVID-19 infections in nursing facilities and other long-term care facilities. Click here for Governor Carney’s eleventh modification to the State of Emergency. Governor Carney’s updated emergency order requires nursing facilities to immediately ensure they are in full compliance with the Public Health Authority guidance related to COVID-19. Nursing facilities must check Division of Public Health (DPH) guidance at least daily to ensure they are complying with the most current guidance and adjust their policies, procedures, and protocols accordingly. “Our elderly populations, and especially Delawareans in long-term care facilities, are at very high risk for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. These stricter measures that we’re issuing today are intended to save lives,” said Governor Carney. “All Delawareans should do their part to protect their neighbors, friends, and family members – especially those who are immunocompromised. We know the weather is getting nicer. But continue to stay at home. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. You’ll only increase the risk for everyone. We’ll get through this. But we need to keep working together.” Governor Carney’s order requires all nursing facilities in Delaware to immediately:  Establish a cohort of staff who are assigned to care for known or suspected COVID-19 residents. Designate a room, unit, or floor of the nursing facility as a separate observation area where newly-admitted and re-admitted residents are kept for 14 days on, while being observed every shift for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.  Designate a room, unit, or floor of the nursing facility to care for residents with known or suspected COVID-19.  Returning residents to their nursing facility remains a priority, according to Tuesday’s order. Residents who have been admitted or seen at a hospital for COVID-19 shall be allowed to return to the nursing facility – as long as the facility follows approved measures from the Division of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If nursing facility residents must temporarily go to other facilities, every effort must be made to transfer the residents back to their original facility as soon as possible. A negative COVID-19 test shall not be required prior to return to a nursing facility. Additionally, Governor Bacon Health Center (GBHC) will serve as a non-acute alternate care site for patients who are discharged from the hospital, have some Activities of Daily Living needs, and are unable to return to their homes in the community or in a long-term care facility due to caregiver or staffing challenges. As previously announced, GBHC is one of the tools the state will use to ensure that critical care beds are available to people who need hospitalization and intensive treatment for COVID-19 infections. Governor Carney’s State of Emergency declaration and its eleven modifications – including the stay-at-home order for Delawareans and mandatory 14-day quarantine for out-of-state travelers – remain in effect and carry the full force and effect of law.  Violations of an emergency declaration are a criminal offense. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19, related to medical or social service needs, should call 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekends. Questions may also be submitted by email at DPHCall@delaware.gov.  DPH will continue to update the public as more information becomes available.

"Governor Carney and Five Governors Announce Multi-State Council to Get People Back to Work and Restore the Economy - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Monday, April 13, 2020","Council Will Include One Health Expert, One Economic Development Expert and Respective Chiefs of Staff from Each State Council Will Develop a Fully Integrated Regional Framework to Gradually Lift the States’ Stay at Home Orders While Minimizing the Risk of Increased Spread of the Virus New Effort Builds on the States’ ongoing Regional Approach to Combatting COVID-19 WILMINGTON, Del. – Recognizing that their states have one integrated regional economy, Delaware Governor John Carney, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, and Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo today announced the creation of a multi-state council to restore the economy and get people back to work. This announcement builds on the states’ ongoing regional approach to combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. The coordinating group – comprised of one health expert, one economic development expert and the respective Chief of Staff from each state — will work together to develop a fully integrated regional framework to gradually lift the states’ stay at home orders while minimizing the risk of increased spread of the virus. Delaware’s representatives will include:  Sheila Grant, Chief of Staff, Office of Governor John Carney Dr. Kara Odom Walker, Secretary, Delaware Department of Health and Social Services Kurt Foreman, President and CEO, Delaware Prosperity Partnership  The council will create this framework using every tool available to accomplish the goal of easing social isolation without triggering renewed spread – including testing, contact tracing, treatment and social distancing – and will rely on the best available scientific, statistical, social and economic information to manage and evaluate those tools. “We still have a situation in Delaware that is getting worse. Infections of COVID-19 and hospitalizations are rising. Delawareans should stay home. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Don’t visit Delaware unless you need to see a doctor, or care for a family member. You’ll only increase everyone’s risk,” said Governor John Carney. “At the same time, we need to look forward. We need a consistent approach for moving our states out of this crisis, when that day comes. I’m grateful for the partnership of my fellow Governors in the region. They are all working around-the-clock to prevent surges in COVID-19 cases, protect hospital capacity for the most critically-ill patients, and save lives. We’ll get through this by working together.” Governor Andrew Cuomo said, “We have been collaborating closely with our neighboring states to combat this pandemic through a uniform approach to social distancing and density reduction and it has been working well. Now it is time to start opening the valve slowly and carefully while watching the infection rate meter so we don’t trigger a second wave of new infections. This is not a light switch that we can just flick on and everything goes back to normal – we have to come up with a smart, consistent strategy to restart the systems we shut down and get people back to work, and to the extent possible we want to do that through a regional approach because we are a regional economy. New York is partnering with these four states to create a multi-state council that will come up with a framework based on science and data to gradually ease the stay at home restrictions and get our economy back up and running.” Governor Phil Murphy said, “No one has given more thought or is more eager to restart our economy than I am, but if we don’t get the sequencing right, we put more lives at risk. The only path to a sustainable economic recovery is through a strong healthcare recovery. Then, and only then, do we position ourselves to fully ignite our economy and get the residents of our state back to work while minimizing the danger of this disease. A coordinated, regional approach, informed by a multi-state council of experts, will help us avoid a major setback with potentially disastrous consequences. I look forward to the day when the facts on the ground allow us to ease our restrictions and move our regional economy forward.” Governor Ned Lamont said, “One thing that’s undeniable is that this virus does not stop at the border of any county, state, or country, but the impact is the same when it comes to our respective economies and healthcare systems. Working as a regional coalition to make the right decisions will lead to the best public health results for all of our residents. We must solve these problems together.” Governor Tom Wolf said, “Our highest priority remains protecting the health and safety of Pennsylvanians. While my administration continues to take critical steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, I also recognize that we must look ahead and take a measured, careful approach to prepare for the future while ensuring that we don’t undo all of our efforts. Pennsylvania will work collaboratively with our partners both in state and in surrounding states to develop a comprehensive strategy that first focuses on health but also addresses the need to gradually restore our economy.” Governor Gina Raimondo said, “States are taking the lead as we fight to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. I’m proud of the steps we’ve taken, and I’m constantly thinking about what it will take to safely reopen our economy. But we know that this virus does not recognize borders, and it’s clear we need a strong, coordinated regional approach to avoid a second wave of this disease. I’m grateful to my fellow governors for their leadership during this crisis and I’m confident that this new partnership will support our efforts to get Rhode Islanders — and all Americans — back to work safely.” Delawareans with questions about COVID-19, related to medical or social service needs, should call 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekends.

Under Delaware law, State of Emergency declarations must be renewed every 30 days.   Also on Friday, Governor Carney released new guidance from the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) on worship services. Delawareans are urged to celebrate the holiday weekend only with their immediate family members to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Houses of worship must, whenever possible, conduct their activities from home or through remote audio or video services. No more than 10 individuals — including clergy, staff, and participants — may be present inside a religious facility during any service.   “This is a difficult weekend as we continue to fight the spread of COVID-19 in Delaware,” saidGovernor Carney. “I know that so many Delaware families across our state – including mine – traditionally celebrate Easter and Passover surrounded by family. This year will be much different for all of us. The best thing you can do this weekend is stay home. Celebrate with your immediate family members. Protect your family – especially those who are immunocompromised – by not putting them at greater risk. Don’t gather in large groups. Call to check in on your parents and grandparents and connect virtually with family and friends. We’ll get through this, but it’s going to take all of us.”   Nextdoor is a neighborhood social networking platform that allows Delawareans to exchange information, goods, and services with their neighbors. Governor Carney’s office plans to share public health updates, links to various resources, and important messages around the State of Emergency on the platform.   Delawareans should continue to visit de.gov/coronavirus for the latest information on COVID-19 in Delaware, and the State of Delaware’s response. Delawareans SHOULD NOT use Nextdoor to request police or emergency services. If you require police or emergency services, call 911.   “This partnership with Nextdoor will really allow us to reach Delawareans at a neighborhood level, and make sure Delaware families are receiving good information throughout this crisis,” said Governor Carney.   Under Delaware law, State of Emergency declarations must be renewed every 30 days. Governor Carney’s State of Emergency declaration and its ten modifications – including the stay-at-home order for Delawareans and mandatory 14-day quarantine for out-of-state travelers – remain in effect and carry the full force and effect of law.   Violations of an emergency declaration are a criminal offense.   Delawareans with questions about COVID-19, related to medical or social service needs, should call 2-1-1; or 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

"DNREC to limit number of people allowed in state parks and wildlife areas, which may close for periods - State of Delaware News","Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control","Division of Fish and Wildlife","Division of Parks and Recreation","Thursday, April 9, 2020","Reminder: Bathrooms closed in public areas; out-of-state travelers must self-quarantine before visiting state properties  DOVER, Del. – The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control announced today it will take steps when necessary to limit the numbers of visitors within state parks and wildlife areas, following crowding and public health concerns. Starting Friday, April 10, administrators of parks and wildlife areas will recommend to DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin that vehicle access be limited at times when visitor usage is observed to be cause crowding and prevent safe social distancing. These limits will be implemented by DNREC’s Natural Resources Police. “As the days have gotten nicer and the stay-at-home period endures, we have been increasingly concerned to see the behavior of some visitors to our state parks and wildlife areas, with full parking lots and increasingly crowded trails,” said Secretary Shawn Garvin. “Limiting the number of people when we see too much crowding will allow us to keep these public spaces open for individuals who need a break and fresh air, but to keep everyone safe.” DNREC provided the following tips and guidance for visiting parks and wildlife areas at this time:  Parks or wildlife areas may be restricted, or areas may be closed if it is determined based on observation of parking lots or groupings of people that lack of responsible social distancing has become an issue. While parks and wildlife areas are large, many visitors use the same amenities. Visitors should try to spread out from others within these areas. Visitors to parks and wildlife areas are urged to limit the time of their visit so the overall number of people in each area is reduced. Consider visiting parks and wildlife areas in off-peak times. For overall visitation, sunnier and warmer days are more popular than cloudier or cooler ones. In many parks, visitors pick up mid-afternoon. Bathrooms remain closed in all parks and wildlife areas and at boat ramps. Beaches are closed except for exercise, dog-walking and some vehicle surf-fishing under restricted conditions. Out-of-state visitors must observe a 14-day quarantine before entering a park or wildlife area. Responsible social distancing practices should always be maintained, even while outside. All currently allowable activities are subject to change.  These provisions all come under the authority of the Governor’s state of emergency declarations and have the force and effect of law. Any failure to comply with the provisions contained in a Declaration of a State of Emergency or any modification to a Declaration of the State of Emergency can constitute a criminal offense. Anyone concerned about an individual or group in any state park or wildlife area may contact DNREC’s Natural Resources Police via Tip411, DNREC’s smartphone app, or by calling the 24-hour DNREC Dispatch Center at 302-739-4580. Tip411 allows the public to easily report concerns. The app is available for free download by searching DENRP via the Google Play Store or the iTunes App Store.

"Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) Issues Guidance Around Masks - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","News","Office of the Governor","Wednesday, April 8, 2020","Delawareans should wear cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining social distancing is difficult WILMINGTON, Del. – Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC), the Division of Public Health (DPH) recommended on Wednesday that Delawareans should wear cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Those settings include grocery stores and pharmacies. Wednesday’s guidance from DPH is for the use of cloth face coverings only. The primary purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect yourself – it is to protect others. Members of the general public are not recommended to wear medical or surgical masks, which should be reserved as personal protective equipment for health care workers. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels. Read the full DPH guidance document around masks.   “Delaware’s response to COVID-19 has been driven by science, and will continue to be driven by science,” said Governor John Carney. “Our goal is simple. We are working to prevent a surge in cases, protect hospital capacity, and save lives. The science tells us that wearing a face covering in certain public settings can help prevent transmission and spread of the COVID-19 virus. But wearing a face covering is not an excuse to spend more time in public. Stay home. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Wash your hands. Disinfect surfaces frequently. It’s important we all do our part to get through this.” Delawareans who wear a cloth face covering should practice strict hand-washing before and after touching the face covering, according to the DPH guidance. Face coverings are not a replacement for washing hands, practicing physical distancing, and staying home. Delawareans who are sick should wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth if they must be around other people – even while at home, according to the DPH guidance.   “Wearing a face covering is not a substitute for existing guidance around hand-washing and social distancing,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, Director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. “Delawareans should stay at home whenever possible, only leaving for essential activities. Wash your hands. Keep 6-10 feet between yourself and others. In public settings like grocery stores, where social distancing is difficult, we are recommending that Delawareans wear cloth face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” Delawareans with general questions about COVID-19 can call the Delaware Coronavirus Call Center at 211, or 711 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

"Additional Alternate Care Site Announced - State of Delaware News","Delaware Emergency Management Agency","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Tuesday, April 7, 2020","Smryna – The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) and the State Health Operations Center (SHOC) are announcing today the plan for an additional alternate care site (ACS) to support Kent and Sussex Counties.  This plan is to accommodate overflow patients from Delaware hospital systems as they begin to experience a surge in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  This mobile hospital will join the two previously designated: the first on the campus of Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children and the second at Governor Bacon Health Center. The site will be a collaborative effort between Bayhealth, Nanticoke Memorial Hospital, and Beebe Healthcare.  The three healthcare systems are coordinating their surge plans with county and state officials.  The primary goal is to maintain the surge within current hospitals.  If needed, the state has offered to set up a mobile hospital as an alternate care site.  Triggers have been identified as well as potential locations dependent on surge.  Site evaluations were performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Delaware National Guard in the weeks preceding.  The Delaware National Guard will provide crucial assistance with preparing, building, and operating this facility.  The field hospital was utilized during a 2016 exercise and the Delaware National Guard stands ready to deploy the unit as previously trained.  The mobile hospital can potentially treat 50-60 patients who do not have COVID-19.  If the site is used for COVID-19 patients that number would be reduced.  Numerous buildings were surveyed, however proximity to existing health care facilities and the accompanying resources are crucial to a successful mission. The hospitals are managing the patients now with their current staffing but we are preparing for the expected increase in the coming days.  This location, like the New Castle County sites, will be opened to alleviate the surge on hospitals when needed.  We are grateful for the efforts of our partners in the health care systems within the state, the Division of Public Health, and the Delaware National Guard for their continued support.

"Consumer-Friendly Auto Insurer Actions Will Give Residents More Than $1.5 Million - State of Delaware News","Captive","Captive Insurance","Insurance Commissioner","Tuesday, April 7, 2020","Premium paybacks, elimination of commercial exemptions during COVID-19 praised by Commissioner Trinidad Navarro Automobile insurers in Delaware are taking a number of consumer-friendly actions in light of COVID-19, the Delaware Department of Insurance announced today. On Monday, Allstate announced it would embark on a premium payback program resulting in $1.5 million going back to Delaware residents. Multiple insurers have also temporarily removed their commercial use exemptions on their private passenger automobile plans to allow policyholders to comfortably gain income as delivery drivers using their personal vehicles, putting income into the pockets of thousands of eligible residents. “As we all do our part to stay home and flatten the curve, our vehicles aren’t being used, and it makes sense for premiums to decrease or be paid back as fewer auto accidents and issues occur. Allstate’s implementation of a premium payback should be seen as a model for auto insurers serving Delawareans, and residents across the country,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro, adding, “I urge all auto insurers to be responsive to the COVID-19 crisis and enact consumer-friendly policies like these.” Allstate announced Monday that they will file an endorsement to enact a shelter-in-place payback that will distribute more than $600 million to their personal auto insurance customers nationwide, including $1.5 million to Delaware residents. Paybacks will equal 15% of a customer’s March and April premiums, payable in April and May respectively. “It’s no secret that fewer cars are on the road,” Allstate stated, “With costs going down, Allstate is working to do what’s right for policyholders…We are trying to respond quickly and decisively to get money to customers when they need it most – now.” The company has also offered a special payment plan for individuals facing financial hardship and is offering Allstate Identity Protection to all residents through the end of the year to combat the rise of COVID-19-related scams. Allstate has extended coverage for customers using personal vehicles to deliver food and supplies during the COVID-19 crisis, a recommendation of the Delaware Department of Insurance. In an April 1 Bulletin to Insurers, the department encouraged companies remove a typically-seen commercial use exemption from their auto insurance policies throughout the pandemic to allow residents to gain income from delivering goods using their personal vehicles. Insurers including Allstate, Farmers, Geico, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, Progressive, State Farm, and USAA have taken this action. Residents are encouraged to check their auto insurance company COVID-19 policies before beginning to provide delivery services. While encouraging insurers to take these steps, the department is waiving notice filing fees and has committed to reviewing provided notices within 24 hours of submission. Tweet this story"

"Alternate Care Sites Announced - State of Delaware News","Delaware Emergency Management Agency","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Monday, April 6, 2020","SMYRNA (April 6, 2020) – The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) and the State Health Operations Center (SHOC) are announcing today the designation of alternate care sites (ACS) in New Castle County to accommodate overflow patients from Delaware hospital systems as they begin to experience a surge in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sites for the southern part of the state are expected to be announced later this week. One alternate care site will be Governor Bacon Health Center, the Department of Health and Social Services’ long-term care facility in Delaware City, said DEMA Director A.J. Schall and Public Health Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. Residents in two units will be transferred over several days this week – along with their current staff – to the Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill, another DHSS long-term facility in Smyrna. The residents from Governor Bacon will be placed in a separate unit at the DHCI Campus, isolated from current residents of DHCI. If all transferred residents clear the 14-day quarantine period, they will be integrated with the current residents of DHCI, said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. Residents of one unit at Governor Bacon will remain on the second floor for 14 days, with the current staff caring for them. If those residents clear the quarantine period, they also will be transferred to Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill. The residents’ families and Governor Bacon staff have been notified of Governor Bacon’s alternate care site designation and the impending move, Secretary Walker said. As floors of Governor Bacon are made available, they will be deep-cleaned by DHSS before they are used as an alternative care site, Secretary Walker said. When all residents are moved to Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill, Dr. Rattay said the State will have the potential of 75 additional beds at Governor Bacon for overflow patients from Delaware’s hospitals. Staffing to care for the potential overflow patients is currently being developed. “We are grateful to the families of the residents and the staff for understanding why we have to move the residents of Governor Bacon,” Secretary Walker said. “Throughout this crisis, our top priority is the health and safety of our residents and also making sure that our staff who care for our residents are safe and healthy as well.” Schall and Dr. Rattay said the other alternate care site being announced today by DEMA and SHOC is within Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children. Nemours will only be accepting transfers from Delaware community hospitals of non-COVID-19 adults.  Nemours duPont Hospital for Children has developed two treatment areas to provide medical care for non-COVID-19 adults. The rehabilitation gym, which is located one floor below the main level and away from pediatric care, has been converted into an alternative care site for low-acuity cases beginning with 38 beds, with possible expansion if needed. A medical intensive care unit will be situated across and separate from the pediatric intensive care unit, and be comprised of 24 beds.    Nemours’s treatment sites can become operational this week, and will begin providing medical care only once capacity is exceeded within Delaware’s community hospitals. Nemours’ surge sites will remain operational until community hospitals can reabsorb these non-COVID-19 adult patients. Schall and Dr. Rattay said last week the State worked with Nemours, St. Francis Healthcare and ChristianaCare to identify options for the northern part of the state. After searching multiple possible sites with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Nemours campus was identified as the location that would provide the most efficiencies.   Nemours has worked diligently over the last week to prep part of its building and this week training will take place with Nemours, ChristianaCare and the Delaware National Guard. Schall and Dr. Rattay said the State, National Guard and Army Corps of Engineers continue to work with Beebe Healthcare, Nanticoke Health Services and Bayhealth for options to place non-COVID-19 patients from the southern hospitals if surge occurs. Site assessments continue today, with potential options being the old Milford Memorial Hospital and a National Guard field option adjacent to one of the current hospitals.  For more information on COVID-19, http://de.gov/coronavirus Follow Delaware Emergency Management Agency on Facebook, https://www.facebook.com/delawareemergencymanagementagency Follow Delaware Emergency Management Agency on Twitter, https://www.twitter.com/delawareema Contact: Jeff Sands, Delaware Emergency Management Agency, 302-659-2211."

"AG Jennings Urges Delawareans to Follow Governor’s Emergency Orders, Keep Themselves and Law Enforcement Safe - State of Delaware News","Department of Justice","Department of Justice Press Releases","News","Monday, April 6, 2020","This release is also available in Spanish.  Enforcement actions have been initiated throughout state to handle noncompliance Attorney General Kathy Jennings urges Delawareans to heed Gov. John Carney’s Declarations of a State of Emergency.  The Declaration of a State of Emergency and all its modifications carry criminal punishment and have been enforced throughout Delaware. “This is a tremendously difficult time for everyone, and the only path forward is for all of us to take this seriously as a community,” said Jennings. “These temporary restrictions are unprecedented, but they are necessary. Everyone’s job right now is to save lives. There is no alternative.  And when people don’t take these orders seriously, we must step in.” “The overwhelming majority of Delawareans have heeded the Governor’s calls to be diligent and to keep their communities safe.  By obeying the emergency orders, you are saving the lives of your family, your friends and your neighbors.  The message to those who ignore the Orders is simple: You are endangering people’s lives, including law enforcement officers, by forcing unnecessary interaction.” Some of the enforcement actions to date have included:  Several individuals have been cited for failure to obey an emergency order, including last week in Newark and elsewhere throughout the state. Six businesses have been issued cease and desist orders for operating in violation of the Orders. The Department of Justice has received more than two dozen formal complaints regarding price gouging and has initiated communication with those businesses. The Consumer Protection Unit today served a subpoena on the Great Valu at Adams Four related to price gouging allegations after the Department’s initial letter went unanswered. Officers throughout our State are enforcing the ban on travelers coming to Delaware from out-of-state and not quarantining. For example, Delaware State Police are operating a checkpoint on Naamans Road in Wilmington, inquiring about out-of-state drivers’ business in Delaware. Additional checkpoints were conducted throughout Sussex County, including the Route 1 corridor in the area of Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach, Route 20 in Long Neck, and Route 113 south of Millsboro. The Department of State has sent several warning letters to businesses, informing them that they will be shut down if their behavior does not change.  Failure to obey an emergency order is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $50 to $500 and up to 6 months in prison per infraction. Additionally, persons or businesses who engage in price gouging activity face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per offense. “Our Troopers will continue to fulfill the mission of the Delaware State Police, which is to enhance the quality of life for all Delaware citizens and visitors, by providing professional, competent and compassionate law enforcement services,” said Delaware State Police Superintendent Col. Nathaniel McQueen, Jr. “They will continue to enforce the laws of the State of Delaware, to include those associated with the Governor’s State of Emergency Declaration, in an appropriate and just manner. Our emphasis and goal in enforcing the orders, specifically in regards to the travel restrictions, is to achieve voluntary compliance through education and awareness. The health and well-being of our Troopers, as well as the community, will remain our top priority as we continue to serve and protect, during this unprecedented event.” The DOJ has publicly issued guidance to law enforcement and the general public on frequent questions about the orders’ practical impact. The DOJ also issued answers to frequently asked questions about the State of Emergency’s price gouging ban. Delawareans who wish to report price gouging should contact the DOJ’s Consumer Protection hotline at (800) 220-5424 or e-mail pricegouging@delaware.gov.  Delawareans can find additional information about the coronavirus and the State’s response at de.gov/coronavirus. Delawareans who have public health questions or need a testing referral and do not have a primary care physician can call the Division of Public Health’s hotline at (866) 408-1899.   An earlier version of this release incorrectly stated that a business owner was arrested due to noncompliance with the Fourth Modification of Gov. Carney’s Declaration of a State of Emergency for the State of Delaware. The business owner was arrested in his personal capacity due to noncompliance with Gov. Carney’s Fifth Modification. As a separate and concurrent matter, his business was issued a cease and desist order for violating the Fourth Modification following multiple police contacts."

"Delaware Correctional Officers and Inmates Contribute to Delaware&#039;s COVID-19 Response - State of Delaware News","Department of Correction","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","Thursday, April 2, 2020","SMYRNA, Del. – This week, three dozen inmates who are employed in the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center garment shop began producing cotton face masks for the correctional system and first responders as the Delaware Department of Correction steps up to support the First State’s COVID-19 response. These skilled inmate workers normally cut and sew material from large rolls of red and white cotton cloth into the clothing worn by more than 4,200 inmates across DOC’s prison facilities. However, As Delaware confronts the challenges of community spread of the illness, the inmates and their Correctional Officer supervisors in Delaware Correctional Industries offered to turn their sewing skills into producing face masks in short supply.  Governor John Carney said, “As this serious situation evolves, we need to find innovative solutions for pressing issues. That is exactly what the Department of Correction has done by shifting the production within the James T. Vaughn Correction Center to provide greater protection to staff and inmates in DOC facilities. We’ll get through this, but we all need to pitch in and take this threat seriously.” Delaware Department of Correction Commissioner Claire DeMatteis said, “We say often that ‘we are all in this together,’ and this initiative by correctional officers and offenders demonstrates that we all want to do our part to help slow the spread of COVID-19. It’s a real-time, real-life demonstration of DOC’s dual mission of public safety and offender rehabilitation.” The mask production effort was originally presented to the DOC by Delaware Correctional Industries Trades Instructor Dion Hawkins, who worked collaboratively with Trades Instructors Lori Quinney Craig Devries, Lee Lepore, Frank Kulhanek and Brett Smith and their team of inmate workers to design and produce a prototype mask last week using two layers of cotton cloth in stock, sewn together around a polyester filter designed to remove particles down to 3-10 microns in size.   Production began Monday on two sewing machines, and by mid-week daily volume increased to nearly 100 face masks.  Up to a dozen inmates will support the operation by cutting patterns and sorting and packing masks, while up to two dozen inmates will operate sewing machines to stitch the materials and add elastic ear loops.  At full production capacity, DOC estimates that it will be able to produce up to 500 face masks each week. Face masks produced at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center will be used, as necessary, in DOC facilities to protect staff, inmates and contractors. Once inventory increases, the face masks will be offered to other first responders.  DOC’s infirmaries and isolation units will continue to use medical grade FDA-certified face masks and other Personal Protective Equipment produced by national manufacturers. Hourly wages for inmate workers are set by state statute and hourly pay rates for inmates employed in the garment shop at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center range between .25 and $2.00 per hour depending on skill level and length of service. Delawareans with general questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

"DNREC Closes Park and Wildlife Area Amenities; Limits Outdoor Recreation Activities at Beaches - State of Delaware News","Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control","Division of Fish and Wildlife","Division of Parks and Recreation","Thursday, April 2, 2020","Out-of-state travelers must self-quarantine before visiting state properties DOVER, Del. – While most state parks, nature and wildlife areas continue to stay open for Delawareans during the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” emergency order from Governor John Carney, many amenities are closed. Current closures include campsites, cabins, cottages, yurts and playgrounds, and now, public restrooms will be closed. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control will close its public restroom facilities, including bathrooms, bathhouses and portable toilets, in state parks, wildlife areas and state boat ramps at the end of the day April 3. All amenities will remain closed until May 15, or until the public health threat has been eliminated. Those who plan to visit any state park, wildlife area or boat ramp should plan accordingly as these amenities will not be available. “We made the decision to close restrooms, which have multiple public touch points,” Secretary Shawn Garvin said. “Our staff has worked tirelessly to maintain the cleanliness of our restroom facilities, but hand sanitizer and soap has been stolen. It has become more difficult to maintain not only the cleanliness, but the social distancing in the facilities. It is no longer safe for our staff or the public to continue this service.” The closures come after Governor Carney signed a series of amendments to his State of Emergency declaration this week to slow the spread of COVID-19. These orders include:  Anyone who enters Delaware from another state must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days. The order applies to individuals who would like to fish, hunt or intended to visit state parks and wildlife areas, including the state’s golf courses. The use of beaches, including those at state parks, has been restricted to exercising, walking dogs, and surf fishing under severely restricted conditions. Some municipalities have further restrictions. Surf fishing is limited to those with a current surf fishing permit with the following restrictions: Only fishing from vehicles will be allowed, only two persons from the same household may accompany the vehicle and both persons must be actively fishing at all times, with distance between vehicles on the beach of 20 yards.  “The more activities that are allowed, the more crowded our beaches will be, which is contrary to the public health imperative at this time,” Garvin said. “We want to be clear that the following activities are not allowed from beaches: boating, surfing, sea kayaking, skim boarding, fishing from the beach not from a vehicle, football, volleyball and any other activity that would add more people to the beach.” Although services are limited, outdoor recreation is still available in compliance with site rules, to include:  birding cycling disc golf dog walking fishing in bays, ponds, rivers and streams drive-on surf fishing with restrictions hiking hunting jogging or running  The amenities not available, open and/or permitted include, but are not limited to:  basketball courts camping gatherings of 10 or more people guided tours, events and programs playgrounds pavilions public park buildings: state park offices, nature centers restrooms rock climbing surfing and skimboarding walk-on surf fishing sea kayaking from the beach sunbathing on the beach Go Ape Course at Lums Pond The Brandywine Zoo  Anyone visiting a state park, wildlife area or boat ramp is required to engage in responsible social distancing practices, avoiding groupings of people. All conditions are subject to change. DNREC Natural Resources Police officers are conducting routine patrols of state beaches, parks and wildlife areas on foot and with marked patrol vehicles throughout the day. Anyone concerned about an individual or group in any state park or wildlife area may contact DNREC’s Natural Resources Police via Tip411, DNREC’s smartphone app, or by calling the 24-hour DNREC Dispatch Center at 302-739-4580.

"Delaware turkey hunting season will open this month with self-serve turkey harvest registration at check stations - State of Delaware News","Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control","Division of Fish and Wildlife","News","Wednesday, April 1, 2020","Turkey hunt day for youth and non-ambulatory disabled hunters April 4, regular turkey season opens April 11 DOVER, Del. – Delaware’s statewide one-day turkey hunt for youth ages 10-15 and for non-ambulatory disabled hunters requiring a wheelchair for mobility will be held Saturday, April 4, followed by the four-week-long spring turkey hunting season from Saturday, April 11 through Saturday, May 9. Hunting hours are a half-hour before sunrise until 1 p.m. Monday through Saturday, with no Sunday hunting. Youth hunters on the one-day turkey hunt must be accompanied by an adult 21 years of age or older who has completed a Delaware-approved turkey hunter safety course and who has a Delaware hunting license or is license-exempt. The accompanying adult may not hunt on the special one-day turkey youth hunt. Only bearded turkeys may be harvested, and the bag limit is one bearded turkey per hunter each year, regardless of where and when a bird is harvested. All harvested turkeys must be registered at an authorized turkey check station by 2:30 p.m. on the day the bird was harvested. A list of available check stations is available at 2020 Turkey Check Stations and on page 27 of the Delaware Hunting and Trapping Guide. (Note: Blue Hen Outdoors in Kent County is not available for checking in turkeys). Harvest data collected by the Division of Fish & Wildlife is used to manage Delaware’s wild turkey population.  Due to coronavirus (COVID-19) considerations, self-registration of harvested turkeys has been enabled by DNREC this year at check stations to accommodate required social distancing. Easily identifiable, residential-style mailboxes are located at each check station, with self-registration cards placed inside each mailbox. To complete registration of a harvested turkey, hunters are required to fill out the card as completely as possible, remembering to sign and date the card. After having done so, remove the small bottom portion of the card and retain it as a receipt, placing the top portion of the card in the slot in the back of the mailbox. DNREC advises if multiple hunters are using or waiting to use a  self-check station, hunters should remain the required six feet (or further) apart from one another – or fill out the registration card at your vehicle using your own pen. Check stations will not be weighing wild turkeys harvested by hunters this season. Hunters who want to have their bird scored and entered into the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) records are reminded to have their turkey’s weight recorded on a certified scale. Please contact your local NWTF representative to have the turkey weighed. Since all Delaware spring turkey season plans are subject to change based on health and safety considerations during the coronavirus period, any changes will be announced by DNREC and also posted on its website. Hunting on state wildlife areas and state forests during the spring turkey hunting season requires carrying the public land permit that was issued through a preseason lottery. The permit will specify the public land and season segment/dates that can be hunted. Hunters participating in the special turkey hunt for youth and non-ambulatory disabled hunters on April 4 may hunt without a public land permit on those state wildlife areas and state forests that are open to turkey hunting during the regular turkey hunting season. Turkey hunters are reminded of the following:  A Delaware hunting license or License Exempt Number (LEN) is required to hunt. More information on hunting license requirements is available at Delaware Licenses, where hunting licenses can also be purchased. To register for a LEN, hunters can go to Delaware Hunter and Trapper Registration or call toll free 1-855-335-4868. To purchase a hunting license, hunters born on or after Jan. 1, 1967, must present a basic hunter education safety course card/number. All turkey hunters 13 years of age and older must have completed a Delaware-approved turkey hunter safety course. Turkey hunters under the age of 13 must be accompanied by an adult 21 years of age or older who has completed a Delaware-approved turkey hunter safety course and who has a Delaware hunting license or is license exempt. The Hunter Education/Turkey Education card certifying successful completion of the mandatory turkey course must be carried when turkey hunting. Registered motor vehicles used to access designated wildlife areas owned or managed by the Division of Fish & Wildlife are required to display a Conservation Access Pass (CAP), with a CAP temporarily not required through April 30, 2020.  Due to cancelation of recent in-person turkey hunter safety courses during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period, the Division of Fish & Wildlife’s Hunter Education Program has developed a free online turkey course to be offered until May 17, 2020. Follow these two steps to complete the course:  Step 1 – Go to the Online Turkey Course to view and take the course online Step 2 – Go to the DNREC Fish & Wildlife website and complete the 20 question test  Students must earn a score of 80% or higher on the test to successfully pass the course. Your test will be reviewed within 24 hours of completion. Students who successfully complete the course will receive an email with instructions on how to print their updated hunter safety card.

Unlike normal surf fishing, surf fishing under the emergency order will only be allowed with the following restrictions: Only fishing from vehicles will be allowed, only two persons from the same household may accompany the vehicle and both persons must be actively fishing at all times, with distance between vehicles on the beach of 20 yards. “This change is designed to allow a source of food and a bit of safely distant recreation, but it is not intended to allow the normal type of surf fishing we see with groups of people engaged in non-fishing activities. The beaches are still not a place for numbers of people engaged in social activities,” DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin said. “For anyone coming from out of state with the intent to surf fish, or trout fish, or hunt, or golf, or go to state parks or wildlife areas, please understand the 14-day quarantine applies, which means coming into Delaware to immediately engage in one of those activities and go back home is not allowed.” For more information, read the full text of the orders from Sunday and Monday.  Sunday’s order has the force and effect of law. Any failure to comply with the provisions contained in a Declaration of a State of Emergency or any modification to a Declaration of the State of Emergency constitutes a criminal offense. While most state parks and wildlife areas are currently open with the exception of beaches for all but exercise and surf fishing, all state park campsites, cabins, cottages, yurts and playgrounds are closed. Buildings such as park offices and nature centers remain closed, and programs and tours are canceled. The Brandywine Zoo and the Go Ape course at Lums Pond State Park will remain closed at this time. Upstate trout season is now open to all residents in seven designated trout streams. Ommelanden shooting range near New Castle is now available to residents by pre-scheduled appointment only. Anyone visiting a park or wildlife area is required to engage in responsible social distancing practices, avoiding groupings of people. All conditions are subject to change.

"Governor Carney Signs Order to Designate Emergency Child Care Sites for Essential Personnel - State of Delaware News","Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","Monday, March 30, 2020","State buildings, essential businesses to screen workers, visitors WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Monday signed the eighth modification to his State of Emergency declaration, which allows child care programs in Delaware to be designated as emergency child care sites in an effort to assist essential personnel during the coronavirus crisis. Read the full text of Monday’s order.  Starting April 6 and continuing until the State of Emergency is lifted, child care may only be provided by child care centers and child care homes that have been designated as “Emergency Child Care Sites” by the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families (DSCYF). In order to be an emergency child care site, child care centers and homes must certify that they are only providing child care to children of personnel working for essential businesses, as defined by Governor Carney’s State of Emergency, and cannot work from home. “We are doing everything we can to prevent a spike in coronavirus cases that could overwhelm our hospital system, and health care workers are on the front lines of Delaware’s response,” said Governor Carney. “This new order will make sure Delaware’s health care workers and other first responders can stay at work, and keep our communities healthy, by providing them access to emergency child care services. We need all Delawareans to do their part. Stay at home. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Wash your hands. Stay informed. We’ll get through this – but we all need to do our part.” The order also allows DSCYF to create a process by which families can enroll their children in designated emergency child care if their current child care facility temporarily closes. DSCYF worked with the Delaware Division of Public Health to create strict health and safety guidelines to help child care providers prepare their facilities. Before being designated as an emergency child care site by DSCYF, a provider must demonstrate that they are able to and will adhere to the following requirements developed by the Office of Child Care Licensing and the Division of Public Health. Interested providers must submit an emergency child care site application online by April 3. As of April 6, all other child care facilities must close until the end of the Governor’s State of Emergency. “We are extremely grateful for the child care providers that are able to keep their doors open and make it possible for those providing essential services to serve Delawareans during this public health emergency.  During this time, child care workers, like other essential personnel, are on the front lines adapting, adjusting and working to help Delaware get through this crisis.  Our child care workers keep our children safe every single day, and now, they must do so under very difficult circumstances. We cannot thank them enough and we will continue to work with them during this time,” said Delaware Children’s Department Secretary Josette Manning. Child care providers and caregivers should check coronavirus.delaware.gov/child-care/ in the coming days for information on how to apply to be an emergency child care site, what the requirements are in order to comply with the designation and how to certify essential personnel status and temporarily enroll children. Also under Monday’s order, state buildings and essential businesses that Delaware’s Public Health Authority deems high-risk shall screen every employee, visitor and member of the public upon entering. Delaware’s Public Health Authority shall develop and publicly post the screening tool to be used by high-risk essential businesses. All state buildings and essential businesses shall display signage that cautions individuals experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 not to enter the premises. Also, all hospitals, nursing and residential facilities, and ambulatory health care services in Delaware, as categorized by the Division of Small Business, shall comply with the Public Health Authority’s guidance for the use of Personal Protective Equipment. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for people who are hearing impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

In total, seven Delawareans have passed away due to complications from COVID-19. The most recent death involves a 92-year-old female from Sussex County who had significant underlying health conditions. The source of exposure is currently under investigation. To protect personal health information, DPH will not disclose additional information about the individual who passed away. There have been 264 total laboratory-confirmed cases in the state since March 11. This includes 32 additional cases since Sunday. Of the Delawareans diagnosed with COVID-19, 156 are from New Castle County, 27 are from Kent County, and 81 are from Sussex County. The total number of positive cases represents a cumulative total of cases, including individuals who are currently ill, and those who are considered recovered. Twenty-two Delaware residents have recovered from COVID-19. Delaware is considering patients fully recovered seven days after the resolution of their symptoms. Three days after symptoms resolve, patients are no longer required to self-isolate at home; however, they must continue to practice strict social distancing for the remaining four days before returning to their normal daily routine. Of the 264 cases, 130 are male and 134 are female. The individuals fall in the age range of 1 to 95. Forty-six individuals are currently hospitalized, 14 are critically ill. The source of exposure for many of these positive cases is unknown, which indicates community spread of the virus is occurring in the state. DPH cannot confirm specific information about any individual case even if other persons or entities disclose it independently. Through the Governor’s State of Emergency, Delawareans are to stay home, except if your business has been deemed essential. The Governor’s order does allow Delawareans who need to see a doctor, pick up a prescription, buy groceries, or engage in other activities essential to their health to leave their residences. If you are sick with any symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and muscle fatigue, stay home. If you are sick and need essential supplies, ask someone else to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy to get what you need. If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, make sure to distance yourself from others, particularly vulnerable populations. Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions – including serious heart conditions, chronic lung conditions, including moderate to severe asthma, severe obesity and those who are immunocompromised, including through cancer treatment – might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. For individuals who are sick, stay home and contact your primary care provider for guidance regarding symptoms and next steps. DPH urges individuals who are sick, even with mild symptoms that would be present with a cold or flu, to stay home to help prevent the spread of illness to others. Statewide testing at standing health facility testing sites require a physician’s order or prescription to be tested (*Bayhealth patients will be pre-screened via phone without needing to see a provider first). These are not walk-in testing sites. Those without a primary care provider can call the DPH Call Center Line at 1-866-408-1899.

"Governor Carney Orders Out-of-State Travelers to Immediately Self-Quarantine for 14 Days - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Sunday, March 29, 2020","WILMINGTON, Del. –  Governor John Carney on Sunday signed the seventh modification to his State of Emergency declaration, ordering all out-of-state travelers into Delaware to immediately self-quarantine for 14 days to fight the spread of COVID-19. Under Sunday’s order, anyone who enters Delaware from another state must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days. The 14-day period is measured from the time of entry into Delaware or for the duration of the individual’s presence in Delaware, whichever is shorter. Governor Carney’s order also applies to anyone who has entered Delaware in the last 14 days. The order does not apply to travelers who are merely passing through Delaware. Anyone who lives out-of-state and commutes to Delaware for essential work is strongly encouraged to work from home. Sunday’s order does not apply to those traveling to care for members of their family. Individuals under self-quarantine can leave their homes to seek medical care. Read the full text of Sunday’s order. Governor Carney’s order will take effect at 8:00 a.m. on Monday, March 30. “Now’s not the time to visit Delaware. We’re facing a serious situation here that is getting worse,” said Governor Carney. “Delawareans need to stay at home, and anyone from another state visiting Delaware should immediately self-quarantine for two weeks. Everyone needs to take this threat seriously. Our goal is to limit a surge in COVID-19 cases that would overwhelm our hospital system. We’ll get through this – but everyone needs to pitch in.” Self-quarantine requires that an individual stay in a quarantine location (home, hotel room or rented lodging); does not go to work, school or public areas; does not use public transportation; separates from other individuals in a residence as much as possible; and avoids sharing personal items. Everyone should continue to follow basic hygiene guidance from the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This self-quarantine requirement shall not apply to public health, public safety, or health care workers, or any other individual assisting an essential business or providing an emergency service related to COVID-19. Sunday’s order has the force and effect of law. Any failure to comply with the provisions contained in a Declaration of a State of Emergency or any modification to a Declaration of the State of Emergency constitutes a criminal offense. The Delaware Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued guidance to state and local law enforcement with additional details about enforcement of Governor Carney’s emergency declaration.

"DHSS Announces Multiple Coronavirus Cases at a Second Care Facility in Delaware - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","News","Saturday, March 28, 2020","NEW CASTLE (March 28, 2020) – The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is announcing that a second care facility in Delaware has multiple coronavirus cases. Six residents of a memory care unit of HarborChase of Wilmington have tested positive for COVID-19, including five who are now hospitalized, according to the Division of Public Health. The current census of that unit is 36. DHSS staff have worked with the assisted-living facility to ensure resident and staff safety. The source of the infection is under investigation. “Responding to multiple cases of COVID-19 in such facilities is among our greatest concerns,” said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. “The populations who live in these facilities are at the highest risk for COVID-19, based on their age and underlying health conditions. Our DHSS team is working closely with the facility’s staff to make sure that the residents with COVID-19 are isolated from other residents, and that staff follow strict safety protocols regarding care of the individuals with the virus and also screening of all who enter the facility.” HarborChase is the second care facility in Delaware to have an outbreak of coronavirus cases. On Thursday, DHSS announced the coronavirus-related death of an 86-year-old male resident of Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in Newark and that six additional residents had tested positive for COVID-19. A seventh resident has since tested positive. On March 13, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued aggressive measures for nursing homes nationwide to follow with respect to safety at their facilities:  Restricting all visitors, effective immediately, with exceptions for compassionate care, such as end-of-life situations; Restricting all volunteers and nonessential health care personnel and other personnel (i.e. barbers); Canceling all group activities and communal dining; Implementing active screening of residents and health care personnel for fever and respiratory systems. In cases of compassionate care, CMS advises that visitors will be equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, and the visits will be limited to a specific room.  On March 16, DHSS issued further restrictive and specific guidance to all facilities serving older adults, including screening protocols for visitors, requirements for disinfecting rooms, and reinforcing resident and staff hygiene. Secretary Walker said as difficult as it is for loved ones not to visit residents of long-term care facilities during the coronavirus crisis, those visitor restrictions are in place to help keep vulnerable residents safe. DHSS’ Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ) is continuing to work closely with long-term care facilities in the state to verify that such strong measures are in place at each facility, and if not, to assist them in implementing stronger protocols.

Getting outdoors is a great way to reduce stress and enjoy fresh air to help physical and mental well-being, however, everyone is reminded to be considerate of others and to act responsibly. DNREC’s Natural Resources Police will have a presence at the streams to monitor fishing and angler activity for crowding and appropriate distancing. Upstate trout season will open in seven designated trout streams in northern New Castle County for only youth anglers under age 16 on Monday, March 30 at 7 a.m., followed by the opening of trout season for all anglers on Tuesday, March 31 starting one half-hour before sunrise. Youth anglers can be accompanied by adults on the March 30 youth day, but only youth can fish that day. White Clay Creek, Red Clay Creek, Christina Creek, Pike Creek, Beaver Run, Wilson Run, and Mill Creek will be stocked with thousands of rainbow and brown trout, including some trophy-sized fish. Trout stocking is currently planned to continue weekly in April at White Clay Creek and periodically at the other streams prior to or until Thursday, April 30. Downstate trout season remains open at Tidbury Pond near Dover and Newton Pond near Greenwood, both of which opened March 7. All plans are subject to change based on health and safety considerations and any changes will be announced. Trout anglers planning to fish the New Castle County trout streams should note the following rules and regulations:  Stocked trout streams are currently closed to all fishing through Sunday, March 29 to accommodate trout stocking, eliminate incidental hooking of trout, and allow stocked trout time to adjust to their new waters, all done to improve trout fishing when the season opens. A Delaware fishing license is required, unless an angler is exempt. A Delaware trout stamp is required until June 30, unless an angler is exempt. Following the opening youth day start at 7 a.m. on March 30, trout fishing at these streams is open one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset, unless otherwise restricted by area rules. The daily possession limit is six trout, except inside or within 50 feet of the designated fly-fishing-only section of White Clay Creek, where the daily possession limit is four trout.  Managed by the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife, proceeds from the purchase of Delaware trout stamps are used to help purchase next year’s trout for stocking. The popular fishery also is supported by federal Sport Fish Restoration funds administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that are generated from anglers purchasing fishing equipment. Delaware fishing licenses and trout stamps are sold online and by license agents statewide that remain open (license sales are suspended at the licensing desk in DNREC’s Richardson and Robbins Building in Dover during the coronavirus outbreak). To purchase a license online or to find a participating agent (agents should be contacted to determine if they are open), visit dnrec.delaware.gov.

"DNREC hosts its first virtual public hearing - State of Delaware News","Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control","Division of Air Quality","","Friday, March 27, 2020","DOVER, Del. – To keep operating amid ongoing concern over the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control yesterday held its first virtual public hearing. The topic of the hearing, which was held by DNREC’s Division of Air Quality as scheduled, was proposed revisions to Delaware’s federally required State Implementation Plan regarding air emissions. “In order to keep our employees and community safe, we must minimize group gatherings and maintain a distance of at least six feet,” said Secretary Shawn Garvin. “This could create a challenge to schedule a hearing, especially those required to be public by law. Our team acted quickly to coordinate with the Department of Technology and Information and with counsel from the Department of Justice to set up this virtual option to keep getting business done during the coronavirus period.” Facilitated by videoconferencing provider WebEx, virtual attendees were able to see and hear the proceedings and view PowerPoint slides in real time. They were able to review the hearing notice and all exhibits online, and can offer written comments for inclusion into the hearing record through April 9, 2020. The hearing addressed revisions to the State Implementation Plan in three areas: certification of Delaware’s Emission Statement program, Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) program, and state requirements for Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). The objectives of the proposed revisions are to certify that Delaware’s programs for emissions statements, NNSR, and RACT, as defined in air quality regulations under the Delaware Code, meet all the requirements of the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone. The proposed revisions may be inspected online with written comments being accepted now through April 9 via the online comment form or via email to DNRECHearingComments@delaware.gov or via email to Lisa Vest, DNREC Office of the Secretary, 89 Kings Highway, Dover, DE 19901. For more information on the proposed revisions, email mark.prettyman@delaware.gov.

"DHSS Announces First Long-Term Care Facility Coronavirus-Related Death; More Cases Confirmed in Newark Nursing Home - State of Delaware News","News","","","Thursday, March 26, 2020","SMYRNA (March 26, 2020) – The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is announcing the first long-term care facility coronavirus-related death in Delaware and the first outbreak of positive cases in such a facility. The death of an 86-year-old male resident of Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in Newark was reported today to DHSS’ Division of Public Health. The individual had underlying medical conditions. This is the second coronavirus-related death in the state. The death of a 66-year-old man from Sussex County was announced earlier today. In addition, six residents of the Newark nursing home tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Division of Public Health. DHSS is actively working with the facility to ensure resident and staff safety. “We are deeply saddened to hear of this individual’s death,” said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. “The population who lives in these facilities are at the greatest risk for COVID-19, based on their age and underlying health conditions. Unfortunately, this death and the confirmed cases at this facility underscore the need for all long-term care facilities in Delaware to follow strict screening protocols for anyone entering their facilities.” On March 13, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued aggressive measures for nursing homes nationwide to follow with respect to safety at their facilities:  Restricting all visitors, effective immediately, with exceptions for compassionate care, such as end-of-life situations; Restricting all volunteers and nonessential health care personnel and other personnel (i.e. barbers); Cancelling all group activities and communal dining; Implementing active screening of residents and health care personnel for fever and respiratory systems.  In cases of compassionate care, CMS advises that visitors will be equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, and the visits will be limited to a specific room. On March 16, DHSS issued further restrictive and specific guidance to all facilities serving older adults, including screening protocols for visitors, requirements for disinfecting rooms, and reinforcing resident and staff hygiene. Secretary Walker said DHSS’ Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ) will work closely with long-term care facilities in the state to verify that these strong measures are in place at each facility, and if, not, to assist them in implementing stronger protocols."

"Governor Carney and DSHA Announce Housing Assistance Program - State of Delaware News","Delaware State Housing Authority","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","Thursday, March 26, 2020","Up to $1,500 in assistance available to Delawareans struggling to pay rent or electric bills due to COVID-19 WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney and Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) Director Anas Ben Addi on Thursday announced a new program to provide emergency housing assistance to renters affected by shutdowns, closures, layoffs, reduced work hours, or unpaid leave due to the COVID-19 health crisis. The Delaware Housing Assistance Program (DE HAP) will provide eligible households up to $1,500 in assistance, with payments made directly to the property owner or utility company. Applications will be available on DSHA’s website at www.destatehousing.com or at de.gov/coronavirus. “From restaurant workers and small business owners, to hair stylists and barbers, we know many Delawareans are facing a very challenging time as they struggle with the economic effects of the public health emergency,” said Governor John Carney. “We hope this assistance program will give Delaware families, especially our most vulnerable neighbors, some peace of mind as this situation continues to evolve.” Earlier this week, Governor Carney issued a Sixth Modification to his State of Emergency Declaration, preventing landlords from evicting Delawareans from their homes during the COVID-19 crisis. Under the order, landlords also cannot charge late fees or interest during a State of Emergency. “By pausing evictions, Governor Carney has taken the necessary steps to keep Delawareans in their homes, but we know that after the crisis, many of our neighbors will continue to face financial challenges,” said DSHA Director Anas Ben Addi. “This rental relief program is designed to help our neighbors in need now to prevent a wave of evictions in the coming months.” DSHA provided $2 million in funding for DE HAP, and New Castle County contributed $500,000. “During these difficult times, we need to pull all of our resources together to help those who are struggling financially because of the COVID-19 crisis,” said New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer. “We know this funding may not solve all of the problems our neighbors are facing, but this program is a great step in the right direction. I am pleased that New Castle County is able to support Governor Carney and DSHA in their efforts.” Several community partners will assist DSHA in processing applications through the program, including West End Neighborhood House, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Community Services, First State Community Action Agency, and the Sussex County Community Resource Center. “The impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented. Every day, we receive numerous calls from Delawareans who are struggling to pay their rent or utility bills because of an unexpected layoff, a reduction in hours, or the closure of a business,” said West End Neighborhood House Executive Director Paul F. Calistro, Jr. “If we can help our state’s residents stay in their homes both during and after this crisis, it will benefit us all. West End is honored to partner with Governor Carney and DSHA on this worthwhile program.” To be eligible for DE HAP, applicants must reside in Delaware and have a maximum household income at or below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) for the county in which they reside. The applicant must also provide documentation showing an impact on their employment or income beginning March 10, 2020 or later that is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes such instances as a layoff, reduced work hours, or needing to take unpaid leave due to childcare or other issues arising as a result of the health crisis. Income eligibility per county is as follows:      80% of County Area Median Income (AMI)     1 person 2 person 3 person 4 person   Sussex $40,400 $46,200 $51,950 $62,350   New Castle $50,500 $57,700 $64,900 $72,100   Kent $37,450 $42,800 $48,150 $53,500      For more information on DE HAP and to access an application, visit de.gov/coronavirus or destatehousing.com.  Delawareans with questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 or 711 for people who are hearing impaired from 8:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, or email DPHCall@delaware.gov.    ###"

"Governor Carney Expands Hospitality Emergency Loan Program (H.E.L.P.) - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","Small Business","Thursday, March 26, 2020","H.E.L.P. to include more industries and additional small businesses WILMINGTON, Del. –  Governor John Carney on Thursday announced the expansion of the Hospitality Emergency Loan Program (H.E.L.P.) to provide financial relief for additional industries impacted because of coronavirus (COVID-19). The expansion makes personal care services businesses – such as barber shops, hair salons, nail salons, and beauty shops – eligible for the program.   Eligible businesses must have been in operation for at least a year and have annual revenue below $2.5 million. The cap on the size of eligible was previously $1.5 million in annual revenue. “Delaware workers and small business owners have been hit especially hard by the restrictions in place to fight this public health threat,” said Governor Carney. “Expanding the HELP program from the Division of Small Business will get more help to more Delaware families and entrepreneurs who are facing significant uncertainty. We all still need to do our part, and take the public health threat seriously. Stay at home. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Practice basic hygiene. We’ll get through this, but everyone needs to pitch in.” H.E.L.P. offers no-interest loans of up to $10,000 per business per month. The loans can go toward rent, utilities, and other unavoidable bills, but cannot be used for personnel costs. The loans have a 10-year term with a nine-month deferment period.  The Division of Small Business has been processing applications that have come in for the H.E.L.P. since it was first announced on March 18 to provide assistance to restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The Division expects to have the first round of payments out to approved businesses by the end of the week. The Division of Small Businesses created a list of the most frequently asked question received from business owners as they completed the application. A list of the questions and answers are provided below. Q: Which businesses qualify for H.E.L.P. under this expansion?  Small businesses that have been in operation for at least a year and have annual revenue at or below $2.5 million in the following industries are eligible to apply:     Restaurants/Food Trucks/Caterers/Bakeries – 7225, 7223 3118 Bars and craft beverage makers – 7224 & 3121 Spectator Entertainment – 7111, 7112, 7113 Recreation Activities – 7121, 7131, 7139 Sightseeing Transportation – 4871, 4872, 4879, 4855 Travel Accommodations – 7211 Personal care services – 8121    Q: Does all the paperwork need to be completed, or should I submit to hold my place in line?  Send in your application and related documents only once you have compiled all of them. Applications will not be placed into the queue for processing until ALL required documentation is submitted.  Q: Will the loan be turned into a grant?    No. H.E.L.P. offers zero interest loans with a nine-month deferment period.  At the end of the nine months, borrowers will be required to start making payments on the amount disbursed under the program.    Q: What do I do if my bank won’t let me accept another loan?   We would encourage you to reach out to your bank to discuss your options. You may still be able to apply for H.E.L.P.    Q: Can I apply if my annual revenue is over $2.5 million? Can I get more than $10,000?  At this time, the program is only open to those businesses with annual revenue at or below $2.5 million and is capped at $10,000 per business per month. Businesses with revenue over $2.5 million are encouraged to reach out to the U.S. Small Business Administration (sba.gov) if they need financial assistance. Any changes to the program will be posted to the Division of Small Business Coronavirus website: delbiz.com/coronavirus    Q: Why do you need all the financial data and business license information?   H.E.L.P. offers loans to eligible applicants. While the process is much simpler than traditional underwriting, this data is needed to verify eligibility for the program.    Q: What if my business is not eligible for H.E.L.P.?  Applications received for ineligible businesses will not be processed. The SBA is offering low-interest Economic Injury Disaster Loans of up to $2 million regardless of industry. More information is available at sba.gov/disaster. If any additions or changes are made to H.E.L.P., the updates will be shared at delbiz.com/coronavirus.    Additional resources for business can be found here.

"Governor Carney Shares Frequently Asked Questions on Essential Businesses - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","Small Business","Tuesday, March 24, 2020","All Non-essential businesses ordered closed at 8 a.m. Tuesday WILMINGTON, Del. –  Governor John Carney on Tuesday provided additional guidance from the State to help employers better understand the fourth and fifth modifications to his State of Emergency declaration, which ordered Delawareans to stay at home whenever possible and closed all non-essential businesses in Delaware to help fight the spread of COVID-19. The most frequently asked questions and answers are provided below. Q: Does the order require that I obtain any paperwork, either as an employer or an employee of an essential business, to clarify that status?  No, it does not, and no such paperwork is needed. A full list of essential industries can be found here. If your business activity is on that list, your business is permitted to remain open as long as it follows all necessary CDC guidelines for safety at this time.  Q: My employer says our business is essential, do I still need to report to work?  Staffing questions should be addressed between employers and employees. As long as employers are following applicable guidelines on both leave and on the recent essential designation, then employees should handle any requests directly with employers.  Q: How do I determine if my business is designated as essential?  The easiest way is to use the four-digit NAICS code associated with the business. If you are the owner of the business, you can locate your NAICS code by a) looking at your unemployment insurance forms, b) looking at your most recent tax returns, or c) searching Google for your industry followed by the term “NAICS code”. If you are not the owner of your business, please contact your manager or other appropriate employment supervisor and ask them for clarification on the business status.  Q: What happens if my business fails to comply with the order, either regarding our status as essential or non-essential, or with following CDC guidelines?  Failure to follow CDC guidelines will result in closure on an individual firm basis until the State of Emergency is lifted. Businesses who continue to operate even if they have been deemed non-essential will be given an initial grace if their failure to comply was done after a good faith effort to clarify their status, but those who do not comply and knowingly do so will be subject to civil and in some cases criminal penalties.  Q: What if my business has multiple NAICS codes?  Follow the least restrictive code. If one code is deemed essential while others are not, the business should be considered essential unless further clarification has been given by the state to you directly or through an industry trade group.  Q: Can I change my NAICS code to a code that is essential?  The NAICS code that should be used is the NAICS code that the business had for their most recent unemployment and/or tax filings prior to the issuance of the State of Emergency. A business classified as non-essential who changes or adds a NAICS code in order to fall under the essential category will be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as a company that knowingly fails to comply with the order.  The Division of Small Business asks that employers review the essential/non-essential list to verify the status of their industry. If they still have questions, businesses should email covid19faq@delaware.gov. To ensure a reply, they are asked to include their NAICS code in the email. ###"

The declaration strengthened Delaware’s health care workforce by enabling those medical professionals with out-of-state licenses, or who are retired but in good standing, to support Delaware’s health care workforce needs. On Sunday, March 22, Governor Carney issued the fourth and fifth modifications to his State of Emergency declaration, ordering Delawareans to stay at home whenever possible and closing all non-essential businesses in the state to help stop community spread of COVID-19.

The Division of Public Health recommends individuals stay home if these symptoms are present,” said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. “This underscores the evolving aspects of this situation and how individuals react differently to the virus.

"Get Outside, But Protect Yourself - State of Delaware News","Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control","Division of Fish and Wildlife","Division of Parks and Recreation","Tuesday, March 24, 2020","DNREC offers tips to enjoy outdoors safely during the coronavirus period DOVER, Del. – With entrance fees to Delaware State Parks and state wildlife areas currently waived, Delawareans are getting outside to stay active and healthy. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control offers a few tips for enjoying the outdoors safely during the coronavirus (COVID-19) period:  Keep your social distance, even when outside. Enjoy less crowded areas. Limit your group to fewer than 10 people and keep at least 6 feet away from other visitors. Avoid close-contact activities. Instead, fish, hike, paddle board, ride a bicycle or explore nature. Don’t rent or share sports equipment. Use your own binoculars, bike, fishing rod, golf disc, kayak, yoga mat, etc. Wipe down sports equipment before and after use. Disinfect gear with federal recommended products including diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol and EPA-registered household disinfectants. Avoid playgrounds. Delaware State Parks has closed all its playgrounds, but they may still be open in other areas. Surfaces like slides and swings have a lot of touch points that could potentially spread the virus. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Wash your hands. Use soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds. If you don’t have access to soap and water, use hand sanitizer until you can wash your hands. If you’re sick, stay home. If you’re sick or have been sick in the past two weeks, please stay home to recuperate.  “If you choose to get outside, please take precautions to protect yourself, your family and your community,” said Secretary Shawn Garvin. “Whether you’re spending time in your own backyard or exploring our state’s nature areas, practice social distancing and be safe. And please watch for possible changing announcement in the interest of public health and safety.” Delaware State Parks offers Play Outside, a map-based, mobile-friendly app helps visitors find parks, natural areas, trails and more.

"Governor Carney Issues Stay-at-Home Order for Delawareans - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Sunday, March 22, 2020","Governor orders non-essential businesses to close at 8 a.m. Tuesday morning WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Sunday issued the fourth and fifth modifications to his State of Emergency declaration, ordering Delawareans to stay at home whenever possible and closing all non-essential businesses in Delaware to help fight the spread of COVID-19. The orders go into effect at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 24, 2020. They will remain in effect until May 15 or until the public health threat is eliminated.  Click here for a full list of essential and non-essential businesses, as defined by Sunday’s order.  Click here for answers to frequently asked questions. Watch Governor Carney’s March 22 video briefing on the latest COVID-19 updates in Delaware.    “This was not an easy decision, but it’s the right decision to protect the safety of Delawareans and Delaware families,” said Governor Carney. “If you have any questions about whether you should be staying home or going out, stay home. Go to work, and go straight back home. If you don’t need food or other essential items, stay home.    “We’re acting with urgency to prevent a spike in coronavirus cases that could overwhelm our hospital system,” said Governor Carney. “Delawareans cannot go out in public unnecessarily. Wash your hands and disinfect surfaces frequently. Essential businesses that remain open must provide easy access to hand washing stations or sanitizer, enforce social distancing, and provide flexible sick leave policies for their employees. That will reduce our risk and help keep all Delawareans healthy. We’ll get through this, but we all need to pitch in and take this threat seriously.” Delaware employers with questions about how they may be impacted can email covid19faq@delaware.gov, or call 302-577-8477 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Emails are encouraged due to potentially high call volume. Early next week, Governor Carney and Delaware public schools will announce next steps on school closures. Leaving your home is allowed under Governor Carney’s order for essential activities. Delawareans may leave their homes to get groceries, pick up a prescription, see a doctor, and engage in other activities essential to their health, and the health and wellbeing of their family members, including pets. Delawareans may also engage in outdoor activity, but must adhere to social distancing guidelines. Additional details are available in the text of Governor Carney’s order. Sunday’s order requires essential Delaware businesses to implement flexible and non-punitive sick leave policies for their employees, in accordance with guidance issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH). Employers must follow social distancing policies, protect high-risk workers, provide hand-washing or sanitizer stations, and follow all health guidelines for internal cleaning. Visitors are not allowed at essential Delaware businesses under Sunday’s order, unless they are providing an essential service. Government agencies are urged to take steps needed to provide shelter for Delawareans experiencing homelessness, in accordance with CDC guidance. Homeless individuals are otherwise not subject to the shelter in place order. Delawareans whose homes are unsafe – such as victims of domestic violence – are urged to and seek a safe, alternative residence. Those at high risk of infection and illness from COVID-19 and Delawareans who are sick are urged to stay in their home except as necessary to seek medical care. State of Delaware offices will remain open but state employees should telecommute wherever possible, in accordance with guidelines from the Delaware Department of Human Resources.  As of March 22, there have been 56 total laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Delaware since March 11. Of the Delawareans diagnosed with COVID-19, 39 are from New Castle County, five are from Kent County, and 12 are from Sussex County.   Delawareans with general questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for individuals who are hearing-impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

"Governor Carney Issues Third Update to State of Emergency - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Governor John Carney","Saturday, March 21, 2020","Delaware beaches closed to help slow spread of coronavirus REHOBOTH, Del. – Governor John Carney on Saturday issued a third modification to his emergency declaration. The new orders close Delaware beaches to help slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The public is prohibited from accessing the beach except to exercise or walk their dogs where dogs are permitted. Local officials may choose to enact tighter restrictions. These modifications go into effect at 5:00 p.m. tonight, March 21, and will last until May 15, or until the public health threat of COVID-19 has been eliminated. “We need everyone to take this situation seriously. We saw too many people on the beaches yesterday and we weren’t seeing the kind of social distancing that we need in order to slow the spread of coronavirus,” said Governor Carney. “This was a difficult decision, but we need folks to follow the rules to keep all Delawareans safe. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Wash your hands and disinfect surfaces frequently. Stay home, especially if you feel sick and even if you have mild symptoms. We will get through this together.” “We fully understand Governor Carney’s decision to close the beaches,” said City of Rehoboth Mayor Paul Kuhns. “This move is for the health and safety for all our citizens.” In the second modification of the emergency declaration issued on March 18, Governor Carney authorized state and local law enforcement to enforce the provision in any State of Emergency. The State of Emergency has the full force and effect of the law, and violations constitute a criminal offense. “Governor Carney’s action to close all Delaware beaches sends a vital message to all Delawareans and those who may be thinking of coming here,” said City of Lewes Mayor Ted Becker. “Our beach communities are a very important part of the state’s economy but they are not equipped to be a safe harbor for those who come from other areas. We urge everyone to shelter in the location of their primary residence.” During a live COVID-19 update on Wednesday, Dr. Karyl Rattay, Director of the Division of Public Health, answered a question about going outdoors to take a walk.

"Modified upstate stream trout season to open in New Castle County streams - State of Delaware News","Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control","Division of Fish and Wildlife","","Friday, March 20, 2020","Anglers encouraged to practice responsible social distancing; trout streams closed March 21 until opening DOVER, Del. –The opening day for Delaware’s spring 2020 upstate stream trout season has been changed to minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period. Trout season will open several days earlier than planned in seven designated trout streams in northern New Castle County for only youth anglers under age 16 on Monday, March 30 at 7 a.m., followed by the opening of trout season for all anglers on Tuesday, March 31 starting one half-hour before sunrise. Youth anglers can be accompanied by adults but fishing on March 30 should only be by the youth. Anglers are encouraged to fish in less crowded portions of the streams and practice recommended social distancing while fishing, which is currently six feet from other individuals, approximately the length of some fishing rods. White Clay Creek, Red Clay Creek, Christina Creek, Pike Creek, Beaver Run, Wilson Run, and Mill Creek will be stocked with thousands of rainbow and brown trout, including some trophy-sized fish. Trout stocking is planned to continue weekly in April at White Clay Creek and periodically at the other streams prior to or until Thursday, April 30. All plans are subject to change based on health and safety considerations, and any further restrictions or changes to the season will be announced. Trout anglers planning to fish the New Castle County trout streams should note the following rules and regulations:  Stocked trout streams are closed to all fishing from Saturday, March 21 through Sunday, March 29 to accommodate trout stocking, eliminate incidental hooking of trout, and allow stocked trout time to adjust to their new waters, all done to improve trout fishing when the season opens. A Delaware fishing license is required, unless an angler is exempt. A Delaware trout stamp is required until June 30, unless an angler is exempt. Following the opening youth day start at 7 a.m. on March 30, trout fishing at these streams is open one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset, unless otherwise restricted by area rules. The daily possession limit is six trout, except inside or within 50 feet of the designated fly-fishing-only section of White Clay Creek, where the daily possession limit is four trout.  Downstate trout season remains open at Tidbury Pond near Dover and Newton Pond near Greenwood, both of which opened March 7. Managed by the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife, proceeds from the purchase of Delaware trout stamps are used to help purchase next year’s trout for stocking. The popular fishery also is supported by federal Sport Fish Restoration funds administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that are generated from anglers purchasing fishing equipment. Delaware fishing licenses and trout stamps are sold online and by license agents statewide that remain open (license sales are suspended at the licensing desk in DNREC’s Richardson & Robbins Building in Dover during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak). To purchase a license online or to find a participating agent (agents should be contacted to determine if they are open), visit dnrec.delaware.gov.

"Governor Carney and Dogfish Head announce partnership for distillery to produce hand sanitizer for State of Delaware - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Friday, March 20, 2020","MILTON, Del. – The State of Delaware and Dogfish Head Craft Brewery are partnering to make more, much-needed hand sanitizer available to the state government. Dogfish Head, one of Delaware’s best-known businesses, began distilling spirits in Delaware in 2002 and has now committed part of its operations to also make hand sanitizer. As it ramps up that production, the company will be providing bulk shipments of the sanitizer to the state in the weeks to come. “Dogfish Head is one of Delaware’s great small business success stories,” Governor John Carney said. “It’s great to see this nationally known company, with its roots in Delaware, step up in a time of such significant need to provide this vital product and assist Delaware restaurant workers who’ve been affected so significantly by the Coronavirus outbreak.” Dogfish Head will sell the sanitizer to the state of Delaware at market price, and 100% of the profits will go into a fund to support Delawareans affected by the Coronavirus. “I never thought Dogfish Head would be in the sanitizer business. But this is a time of crisis, and necessity is the mother of invention,” said Sam Calagione, founder of Dogfish Head. “It is our duty to do what we can to keep as many people safe and healthy in our community.” At this time, Dogfish Head has dedicated its sanitizer inventory to fulfilling critical needs of the state, including providing the product to healthcare facilities and first responders. While the Dogfish production brewery and distillery remain open in Milton, Calagione has closed Dogfish Head Inn, Dogfish Head Brewing & Eats, Chesapeake & Maine and the brewery’s Tasting Room & Kitchen. On Thursday, March 12, Governor Carney issued a State of Emergency declaration to mobilize state resources to prepare for the spread of coronavirus across Delaware. On Monday, March 16, he updated that order to require restaurants, taverns and bars move to take-out and delivery service only. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 or 711 for people who are hearing impaired from 8:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, or email DPHCall@delaware.gov. For the latest on Delaware’s response, go to de.gov/coronavirus. ###"

Tests will be administered at no cost to the patients. Through a collaborative effort between the Division of Public Health (DPH), Delaware Healthcare Association, and each of the health care systems in the state, this statewide plan aims to streamline the testing process, reduce the burden on the health system, ensure the safety of patients and health care workers, and better meet the COVID-19 testing needs of Delawareans. “As this situation continues to evolve, we know that we will continue to see an increase in positive cases of the virus. It is critically important that we all work together to reduce the burden on our health system and keep Delawareans safe,” said Governor Carney. “Our goal right now is to limit the spread of the virus. The community-based testing plan we are announcing today builds on our already established infrastructure in Delaware’s health system in an effort to make testing more readily accessible for those in need.” Beginning Monday, March 23, Delaware health systems will operate standing health facility test sites, where health care staff will test individuals who have been evaluated by a medical provider and have symptoms consistent with COVID-19. A physician order or prescription is required. Standing health facility test sites will include:  New Castle County: ChristianaCare will operate two testing sites, one in Newark, one in Wilmington; Saint Francis Healthcare will operate one site in Wilmington. Kent County: Bayhealth will operate one testing site in Dover. Sussex County: Beebe Healthcare will operate two testing sites, one in Millsboro and one in Frankford; Nanticoke will operate one testing site in Seaford.  Symptomatic individuals who want or need a COVID-19 test and who have access to a health care provider will need to be evaluated by their provider. Teleconsultation is preferred unless the provider determines in-person consultation is needed. If COVID-19 symptoms are present, the patient can be referred to a standing health facility test site. Individuals who do not have access to a health care provider can call the DPH Call Center, or call centers run by Christiana Care or Bayhealth, and medical personnel will determine if the caller meets criteria for testing. Medical personnel will provide the appropriate documentation that will give the caller access to testing at a standing health facility test site. If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath, before leaving your home, call your health care provider or the DPH Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 first to discuss whether you should be tested for coronavirus. Importantly, testing is NOT recommended for those who do not have symptoms. There is no need to go to the emergency room, unless you are having significant difficulty breathing. Delaware’s hospitals are prepared for coronavirus, but it is important to preserve resources for those that truly need them and avoid unnecessarily exposing vulnerable people to the virus. If you have a medical emergency, call 911 and make sure to let the dispatcher know what symptoms you are experiencing. “Effective response takes all of us working together. Our hospitals and the Division of Public Health will continue in close collaboration through this event,” said Wayne Smith, President & CEO of the Delaware Healthcare Association. “Delawareans also have a critical role to play in keeping our health care providers safe: if you suspect you have been exposed to coronavirus, stop and call your health care provider first. It is vitally important that you do not go directly to your doctor’s office or the Emergency Room to protect the health of health care providers and vulnerable populations.” There have been 38 total laboratory-confirmed cases in the state since March 11. This includes eight additional cases since yesterday. Of the Delawareans diagnosed with COVID-19, 27 are from New Castle County, five are from Kent County, and six are from Sussex County. Additional aggregate demographic information will be provided as part of the Division of Public Health’s daily update. If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, stay home and make sure to distance yourself from vulnerable populations. This includes people 60 years of age and older; people with serious chronic health conditions such as diabetes, lung disease, or heart disease; or those who are immunocompromised. Many individuals infected with COVID-19 recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids and taking pain and fever-reducing medications.

"New Bulletin Provides Recommendations to Insurers During COVID-19 - State of Delaware News","Captive","Captive Insurance","Insurance Commissioner","Friday, March 20, 2020","Insurers asked to waive prior authorization requirements, cease cancellations and nonrenewals due to missed or delayed payments Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro and the Delaware Department of Insurance today issued a bulletin with recommended actions for the insurance industry. Requests included asking health insurers waive all prior authorization constraints for lab testing and future treatment of COVID-19, and that insurers consider ceasing cancellations or nonrenewals of insurance policies due to nonpayment throughout the duration of the declared Delaware State of Emergency. “The insurance industry has the opportunity to help tens of thousands of Delaware residents, businesses, and healthcare providers during this state of emergency,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “Waiving prior authorization requirements would help the entire healthcare system to run more efficiently and allow providers to focus on patient outcomes rather than paperwork.” Prior authorization is a process that requires certain tests, medications, or other health services to be pre-approved by an insurance company before a medical provider serves an insured consumer, which can at times result in delays. Should prior-authorization be voluntarily waived by insurers, that would not mean that residents should not be in contact with their primary care provider prior to visiting a COVID-19 testing site. The bulletin also asked insurance carriers to voluntarily freeze cancellations and nonrenewals of policies that might have otherwise occurred due to delays in payments through the duration of the state of emergency. “Throughout Delaware’s State of Emergency, many companies have had to close or reduce their business, and employees have been laid off or fired as a result,” Commissioner Navarro explained. “After hearing from businesses and residents who were concerned about the choices they will have to make with limited finances, we ask insurers to help alleviate some of that stress and ensure that residents and business owners in this difficult situation can have the peace of mind that insurance provides throughout the duration of the emergency.” Business interruption coverage will vary policy to policy, and some business interruption coverage may explicitly exclude viral infections. Companies are urged to review their related insurance policies and contact their insurance company with questions about coverage. Hospitality small businesses and nonprofits may be able to apply for no-interest loans from the Division of Small Business Hospitality Emergency Loan Program (HELP). Organizations can receive a $10,000 maximum loan per month for rent, utilities, and other unavoidable, non-personnel bills. On March 18, Governor Carney’s updated State of Emergency Declaration waived certain telemedicine regulations to expand access to these services. The Governor clarified that residents do not need to see a provider in-person before receiving telemedicine services, and that if a Delaware resident is out-of-state, they can still receive telemedicine services. To increase availability of these services, out-of-state providers who are licensed to provide telemedicine in other jurisdictions will also be able to serve Delaware residents through the duration of the emergency declaration. Telehealth and telemedicine can be provided via phone, webcam, facetime, and a myriad of other easily accessible options, as the department recently reminded insurers via bulletin.

"Governor Carney Signs Executive Order on Child Care - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Department of Education","Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families","Thursday, March 19, 2020","Order will allow flexibility to provide child care options for Delaware families, health care workers WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Thursday signed Executive Order #38, which will allow the State of Delaware and providers flexibility to provide child care options for Delaware families and health care workers due to the coronavirus (COVID-19).  Read Governor Carney’s Executive Order #38. “The coronavirus is taking a serious toll across our state, on families who are losing income, and child care providers who care for our youngest Delawareans every day,” said Governor Carney. “This Executive Order will help make sure Delawareans have access to child care over the long run, especially those healthcare workers who we need on the front lines of our state’s response. Every Delawarean should take this situation seriously. Our goal is to limit spread of the virus, and prevent a spike in cases that our health care system cannot handle. Don’t go out in public unnecessarily. Wash your hands and disinfect surfaces frequently. Stay home if you feel sick, even if you have mild symptoms. We’ll get through this. I want to also take this opportunity to thank our child care workers. We could not take on this challenge without you.” Governor Carney’s Executive Order #38 gives the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families (DSCYF) the ability to suspend or modify provisions of the state’s childcare rules, regulations and statutes – as long as changes will not endanger the safety or welfare of a child. Under the Executive Order, DSCYF may work with existing providers to designate emergency childcare sites for children of health care workers, emergency medical staff, law enforcement, and other essential personnel. This change in regulatory process will last only as long as Governor Carney’s State of Emergency declaration remains in place. Governor Carney, DSCYF Secretary Josette Manning, Department of Health and Social Services Secretary (DHSS) Kara Odom Walker, and Department of Education (DOE) Secretary Susan Bunting, also sent a letter to providers with further guidance on questions relating to Purchase of Care and health best practices.  Delawareans with questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for people who are hearing impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

Legislative session originally was scheduled to resume on Tuesday, but was postponed last week due to the spread of COVID-19 and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and Delaware public health officials.

Legislative leaders will continue to examine the situation with input from public health experts and executive branch agencies to determine the best path forward. Rep. Schwartzkopf and Sen. McBride noted that the General Assembly is preparing plans that will be used in the event lawmakers must reconvene to pass legislation that addresses the effects of the Coronavirus on Delawareans and state government. Additionally, the General Assembly is constitutionally required to pass an operating budget by June 30, and plans are being discussed to meet that obligation should this State of Emergency stretch well into the spring.

Exploiting a pandemic for profit is not just shameful and dangerous—it’s also illegal.” Governor Carney’s March 12 Declaration of a State of Emergency explicitly prohibits price gouging, defined as a 10 percent or greater increase in prices above normal levels, except when the increase is attributable to increased supplier costs: No entity doing business in this state shall engage in price gouging as a result of this public health emergency, which shall mean an excessive price increase of goods or services offered for sale beyond the sale price in the usual course of business immediately prior to the date of this state of emergency, unless the increase is attributable to additional costs imposed on the supplier of such goods or services, such price not to increase more than 10% from the cost customarily applied in the usual course of business prior to this state of emergency.  A violation of this paragraph shall be deemed an unlawful practice under § 2513 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code and a violation of Subchapter II of Chapter 25 of Title 6. Consumers should report suspected price gouging to the Delaware Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Unit through a formal complaint. Consumer complaint forms can be found at de.gov/consumer and should be submitted along with any supporting documentation to consumer.protection@delaware.gov.

"Governor Carney Announces HELP Program to Support Delaware Small Businesses - State of Delaware News","Governor John Carney","Office of the Governor","","Wednesday, March 18, 2020","Hospitality businesses will be eligible for immediate financial assistance, unemployment benefits for workers expanded WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Wednesday announced the Hospitality Emergency Loan Program (HELP) to provide financial relief for restaurants, bars and other hospitality industry businesses that employ thousands of Delawareans.  “Restaurants, bars, hotels, and other hospitality-related businesses, and their workers, are among those most seriously impacted by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Delaware,” said  Governor John Carney. “We’ve limited restaurants to takeout and delivery services and asked all Delawareans to avoid being out in public unnecessarily. Many people from other states have postponed non-essential travel, meaning they are not coming to Delaware for vacations or business. We feel it is crucial that the state step in to assist these businesses and their employees.” The no-interest loans are capped at $10,000 per business per month. The money can cover rent, utilities and other unavoidable bills but cannot be used for personnel costs. The loans have a 10-year term with payments deferred for nine months. The Division of Small Business will administer the program using existing state funds and is aiming to have an application available later this week. Eligible businesses must have been in operation for at least a year, have annual revenue below $1.5 million and be in a certain hospitality-connected industries. Email business@delaware.gov to learn if you qualify or call 302-739-4271 with additional questions. Assistance is also available for Delaware workers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Governor Carney approved the following changes to Delaware’s unemployment benefits program for the hospitality industry:   The Department of Labor (DOL) will begin processing unemployment claims as they are received with the goal of  benefits becoming available within a week.   DOL will allow part-time income while collecting benefits as long as employees can demonstrate their decreased hours and earnings. DOL will not classify tipped employees as minimum wage earners as long as their tips are reported as wages.   Businesses applying for assistance through Delaware’s HELP  program will need to prove they meet the eligibility standards. This includes providing documentation to show the business has been current for at least 80 percent of payments over the past 12 months, and not past due on its most recent payment on any bill for which it is applying for relief. This can be done through proof of payments or a letter from the entity to which the money was due. The program announcement comes as the state also awaits official confirmation from the U.S. Small Business Administration that it has received the Economic Injury Declaration which Governor Carney formally requested on Monday. More information will be available later in the week on sending in application information for HELP.

"Public Health Announces Additional Positive Cases of Coronavirus - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","News","Tuesday, March 17, 2020","DOVER (March 17, 2020) – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing eight additional positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) bringing the statewide total to 16. Seven of the eight individuals are New Castle County residents, and one is the first reported case in Sussex County. Four of these individuals are males, and four are females. The ages fall within the range of 18 to 70. All but one is self-isolating at home; one in New Castle County is hospitalized. Six of the seven New Castle County residents participated in the ChristianaCare Health System drive through testing event. The Sussex County resident had a travel-related exposure. The source of the exposure of the remaining individuals is under investigation. DPH will not be disclosing additional information about the individuals. DPH does not have the results for all of the patients who attended drive-through event; the hospital system that performed the testing will report results to the patients, and all positive results to DPH. DPH’s guidance for individuals who are well, are to limit social contacts while practicing social distancing from others (keeping six feet apart), and finding alternative ways to greet people that don’t involve shaking hands, as well as practicing good hand and cough hygiene. However, individuals who are at elevated risk, which includes persons age 60 and older and those with chronic underlying health conditions, are urged to remain at home to limit their exposure to germs. For individuals who are sick, particularly with fever, cough and shortness of breath, stay home, and contact your primary care provider for guidance regarding symptoms and next steps. Testing for coronavirus disease is not recommended for individuals who do not have any symptoms of illness. For individuals who have symptoms of illness (fever and cough, or shortness of breath), specimens will be collected by medical providers and run at either a commercial laboratory or the Public Health Lab. Medical providers must collect specimens for testing; specimens are not collected at the DPH Lab or at commercial labs. Medical providers should evaluate patients and rule out other causes of illness first before recommending testing for COVID-19. While testing for the disease at the Public Health Lab requires DPH approval, providers do not need DPH approval to submit test samples to commercial labs. With commercial lab testing now available, Delaware has enough capacity to accommodate its current testing needs. Providers only need to collect nasal swabs as they would for flu to submit samples for testing. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection at this time. While in some cases illnesses can be severe and require hospitalization, many individuals infected with COVID-19 recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids and taking pain, and fever-reducing medications. DPH reminds Delawareans to use everyday measures to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of COVID-19:  Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails, for 20 seconds. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Do not touch your face, eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean commonly used surfaces such as computers, desktops, countertops cabinets, handles and more with disinfectant. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.  If you are healthy, the CDC does not recommend buying or using face masks. You should only wear a mask if a health care provider tells you do so. Delawareans with general questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for individuals who are hearing impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, or email DPHCall@delaware.gov.

The new Unemployment Insurance guidelines to be issued by the Secretary of Labor are as follows:  Workers will be eligible to receive unemployment benefits if an employer needs to curtail or shut down operations temporarily because of the Governor’s State of Emergency declaration or the coronavirus outbreak. A worker who has been ordered by a medical doctor to self-quarantine as a result, or due to risk of exposure to coronavirus COVID-19 will be eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Parents or guardians who have been forced to quit or take unpaid leave from their jobs to care for children due to the Governor’s emergency closure of schools will be eligible for benefits. Workers who have been forced to quit or take unpaid leave to care for a loved one who has contracted coronavirus COVID-19 will be eligible for benefits. If a worker falls ill to COVID-19 and is unable to work, they may be eligible for unemployment benefits. Part-time workers may be eligible for benefits. The definition of weekly work search requirements will expand to include a wide variety of activities that meet the requirement, unemployment insurance deadlines may be modified for mandatory appointments, and applying for training programs or mandatory re-employment service appointments and workshops.

In his letter to the SBA, Governor Carney said the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on small businesses would likely be significant. “We know that the public health restrictions we put in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus will hit Delaware’s small business community especially hard,” said Governor Carney. “We will continue to work with the Small Business Administration, and with our congressional delegation and state agencies, to provide relief to those small businesses impacted during this time.”  Governor Carney has directed the Delaware Division of Small Business and Delaware Department of State to look for additional opportunities to support the state’s 25,000 small businesses.  Once the state’s application to the SBA is approved, the low-interest loans of up to $2 million per business will be available for many small businesses and nonprofits that have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. They are designed to help with the temporary loss of revenue these businesses and nonprofits are experiencing. The loans may be used for working capital expenses such as payroll, fixed debts and accounts payable, as well as other bills the business or nonprofit is currently unable to pay because of the impact of COVID-19.

"Public Health Announces Eighth Positive Case of Coronavirus in Delaware - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","News","Monday, March 16, 2020","DOVER (March 15, 2020) – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing the eighth positive case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The case involves a New Castle County woman over the age of 50. The individual is not severely ill and is currently self-isolated at home. She was exposed to a positive case in another state. Epidemiologists from the Division of Public Health indicated she has minimal close contacts in the state and are working to identify any who were possibly exposed to provide guidance. DPH will not be disclosing additional information about the individual. With the additional number of test samples that health care systems and providers across the state are submitting to commercial labs, the numbers of patients being tested have increased significantly. To ensure that DPH is reporting the most accurate numbers, going forward the agency will only be releasing the number of positive cases in Delaware, and not the numbers of patients under investigation (PUIs) or the number of persons being monitored. The number of positive cases will be updated on the DPH website de.gov/coronavirus. Symptoms of COVID-19 are most similar to lower respiratory infections with patients having fever, cough, and shortness of breath. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection at this time. While in some cases illnesses can be severe and require hospitalization, many individuals infected with COVID-19 recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids and taking pain, and fever-reducing medications. Testing for coronavirus disease is not recommended for individuals who do not have any symptoms of illness. For individuals who have symptoms of illness (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), testing is being run at both the Delaware Public Health Lab as well as commercial labs. Medical providers must collect specimens for testing; specimens are not collected at the DPH Lab or at commercial labs. Medical providers should evaluate patients and rule out other causes of illness first before recommending testing for COVID-19. While testing for the disease at the Public Health Lab requires DPH approval, providers do not need DPH approval to submit test samples to commercial labs. With commercial lab testing now available, Delaware has enough capacity to accommodate its current testing needs. Providers only need to collect nasal swabs as they would for flu to submit samples for testing. Commercial labs are required to report testing and results to DPH. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for individuals who are hearing impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, or email DPHCall@delaware.gov.

Governor Carney’s updated emergency declaration — which takes effect at 8:00 p.m. tonight, March 16 — also bans public gatherings of 50 or more people, consistent with updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and closes gaming activity at Delaware casinos.

Receiving waivers for the operation of the federal School Nutrition Programs means that most of our districts and charter schools will be able to provide meals for students who may need them during the time they are not in school due to COVID-19,” Secretary of Education Susan Bunting said. “Additionally, the state is in communication with other organizations that may assist in the provision of meals for students during this time.”   Please find a list of open meal sites for students here (https://www.doe.k12.de.us/covid19).  Families may pick up meal bags for children 18 and under who live in their home.

"Guidance on Childcare Centers - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Department of Education","Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families","Sunday, March 15, 2020","Email from Governor John Carney:   This is an uncertain time, and Delawareans have understandable questions about the potential impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on their families and communities.   We’ve repeatedly heard versions of this question:  Why would the state close schools, but recommend that childcare centers remain open?   The current guidance from the Delaware Division of Public Health on childcare centers is that it is safe for them to stay open. The guidance from the CDC is the same. These are controlled environments. We know who comes in, and who goes out. Children are not a high-risk population for infection or serious illness — though they can transmit the virus to high-risk populations.   While the same can also be said for schools, I directed Delaware public schools to close from March 16-27 because there is significant uncertainty around spread of the virus, and how long this outbreak may last. Schools need this time to plan for the possibility of extended closures. They need to make sure they can provide learning opportunities in the event of extended school and business closures. They need plans to deliver meals and other social services that children and families rely on — and will continue to rely on — in the event this lasts for weeks or months. Over the next two weeks, state officials will help school leaders develop those plans.   We need this pause in our K-12 schools, and keeping childcare centers open during this period will help us prepare for what comes next. Closing childcare centers today would have significant impacts on Delaware workers and families, including our state’s front line health care workers, and ultimately make it harder for us to respond to the outbreak.   Let’s be clear: every decision we make is intended to protect Delaware families.  To that end, we are relying on our experts at the Division of Public Health, and the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, for day-to-day guidance, and up-to-the-minute advice.    If at any point the guidance shifts and we believe there’s a risk that indicates closure, we will move to close childcare centers. That day could come tomorrow. It could come next week. It may never come. But today, we are asking centers to stay open based on the guidance.   We are also working hard to make sure that childcare workers continue to get paid in the event of closures.    Delawareans can help us fight the spread of this virus. Wash your hands. Cover your cough. Stay home as much as you can, and don’t go to work if you feel sick. We will get through this — and the precautions you take will help.   Sincerely,   Governor John Carney"

"Delaware Issues Guidance for Child Care Providers on Coronavirus - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families","Division of Public Health","Saturday, March 14, 2020","SMYRNA (March 14, 2020) – The State of Delaware issued guidance today to assist non-public school child care facilities with their response to the global outbreak of respiratory coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Based on advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Delaware Division of Public Health does not recommend closing non-public school child care settings at this time. The data available from 74,000 cases that occurred in China, show that only 2 percent of individuals under 19 years of age tested positive for COVID-19. “Children appear to be less vulnerable to this virus and based upon the science we have now, it does not indicate that closing child care facilities will help in reducing the spread of COVID-19,” said Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. “Child care centers are controlled environments generally with small classroom sizes. Providers know who is coming in and out, who is sick, and are able to restrict access to help reduce risk. We are constantly evaluating information, but right now, parents should continue sending their children to child care to help provide structure.” Suggested preventive measures that child care facilities should include:  Increase handwashing procedures throughout the day for staff and children using soap and water and scrubbing vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Remind adults and children to avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. Strictly enforce the child care facility’s illness policy for both children and staff. Separate sick students and adults from others until they can go home. Rigorously implement cleaning for toys and surfaces. Remove and sanitize mouthed toys immediately. Regularly launder soft items such as washable plush toys, bedding, and clothing.  More information on guidance for child care facilities is available online at the CDC website. “While families can typically make do for a day or two when schools are closed, longer closures make it harder to find child care,” said Ray Fitzgerald, Director of DHSS’ Division of Social Services. “We know parents are concerned about their employment and keeping non-public school child care open helps to reduce that worry.” Testing for coronavirus disease is not recommended for individuals who do not have any symptoms of illness. For individuals who have symptoms of illness (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) testing is being run at both the Delaware Public Health Lab as well as private labs such as LabCorp. Medical providers should evaluate patients and rule out other causes of illness first before recommending testing for COVID-19. While testing for the disease at the Public Health Lab requires DPH approval, providers do not need DPH approval to submit test samples to private labs. With the addition of commercial lab testing now available, Delaware has enough capacity to accommodate its current testing needs. Providers only need to collect nose swabs as they would for flu to submit samples for testing. Commercial labs are required to report testing and results to DPH. Delawareans with questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for individuals who are hearing impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, or email DPHCall@delaware.gov.

"DPH Announces 2 More Presumptive Positives; Individuals Associated With UD Community - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","News","Saturday, March 14, 2020","SMYRNA (March 14, 2020) – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing two more presumptive positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing the total number of cases to six. The two individuals are associated with the University of Delaware community, and are linked to the initial presumptive positive cases. The individuals are a woman older than 50 and a man older than 60, both from New Castle County. Both are self-isolating at home. Epidemiologists from the Division of Public Health are working to identify close contacts of the two individuals who may have been exposed. If other people are found to have possibly been exposed, state health officials will provide guidance to these individuals and monitor them closely for the development of symptoms. Delaware testing numbers will be updated later today. DPH will not be disclosing additional information about the individuals. “The additional cases involving individuals from the University of Delaware community are concerning, but we will monitor the individuals with COVID-19 and identify their close contacts,” said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. “DPH is working closely with the CDC, hospitals, clinicians, and other medical providers to proactively identify and respond to any possible cases of COVID-19. We will continue to keep the public fully informed as additional information becomes available.” Students, faculty, and staff who have general questions about the University of Delaware’s response to COVID-19 should contact the University of Delaware’s Call Center at 302-831-1188 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. In response to the growing number of cases in the United States, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up $50 billion in federal funds to combat COVID-19. On Thursday, Delaware Governor John Carney declared a state of emergency that went into effect on Friday. The Governor on Friday also directed all Delaware public schools to close March 16-27 to allow schools to prepare for the potential spread of coronavirus. Symptoms of COVID-19 are most similar to lower respiratory infections with patients having fever, cough, and shortness of breath. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection at this time. While in some cases illnesses can be severe and require hospitalization, many individuals infected with COVID-19 recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids and taking pain, and fever-reducing medications. Testing for coronavirus disease is not recommended for individuals who do not have any symptoms of illness. For individuals who have symptoms of illness (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), they should contact their primary care provider, who can collect specimens and send them to either the Delaware Public Health Lab or LabCorp for testing. Medical providers should evaluate patients and rule out other causes of illness first before recommending testing for COVID-19. While testing for the disease at the Public Health Lab requires DPH approval, providers do not need DPH approval to submit test samples to LabCorp. With the addition of commercial lab testing now available, Delaware has enough capacity to accommodate its current testing needs. Providers can use flu kits to collect a nasal swab for testing. Commercial labs are required to report testing and results to DPH. DPH advises older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encouraging them to “avoid crowds as much as possible” to reduce their risk of contracting coronavirus disease. If you are in the higher-risk groups for getting very sick from COVID-19, the CDC recommends you should:  Avoid non-essential travel such as long plane trips and defer all cruise trips worldwide. Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated space, as much as possible. When you go out in public, including to doctor appointments or dialysis, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often. Take everyday precaution to keep space between yourself and others. If an outbreak does occur, stay home as much as possible. Stock up on supplies, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, food and water, and other household items. Have a plan in the event you get sick, including discussing with household members, other relatives, and friends what you might need.  The public can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for those with hearing impairments, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

Delaware is experiencing a particularly serious flu season with 6,441 lab-confirmed cases and 11 deaths statewide, and in addition to getting your flu shot, DPH recommends everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease:  Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails, for 20 seconds. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Do not touch your face, eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean commonly used surfaces such as computers, desktops, countertops cabinets, handles and more with disinfectant. Stay home when you are sick. If you are healthy, the CDC does not recommend buying or using face masks. You should only wear a mask if a health care provider tells you do so. Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.

"DHSS Recommends Nursing Homes and Other Long-Term Care Facilities Temporarily Ban Visitors to Reduce Coronavirus Risk - State of Delaware News","Delaware Emergency Management Agency","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Thursday, March 12, 2020","NEW CASTLE (March 12, 2020) – The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is recommending that all Delaware nursing homes, long-term care facilities and adult day-care centers temporarily end visitation as a way to reduce the risk of residents and clients contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The recommendation follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance that urges long-term care facilities to be vigilant in preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19. DHSS’ Division of Public Health and DEMA are working with DHSS’ Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ), Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities (DSAAPD) and other community partners to implement strategies and restrictions to keep residents safe and healthy. In addition to restricting visitors, DHSS is urging Delaware’s long-term care facilities to:  Make online methods of face-to face communication and phone calls available. Staff should be monitored if they are showing any signs of respiratory infection such as fever, cough or sore throat. Any staff member who has these signs or symptoms should not go to work. Any staff that develop these signs or symptoms on the job should immediately stop working, put on a face mask, and self-isolate at home. Nursing homes should increase availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, tissues, no-touch receptacles for disposal, and face masks at entrances, waiting rooms, and resident check-ins Signage should be increased for vigilant infection prevention. Properly clean, disinfect, and limit sharing of medical equipment between residents and areas of the facility.  The CDC has found that early data suggests older people are twice as likely to suffer a serious illness from coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Earlier this week, DHSS urged older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow CDC guidance that they “avoid crowds as much as possible” as a way to reduce their risk. Delaware announced its first presumed positive cases this week and the Division of Public Health (DPH) and other state partners are planning for the likelihood of community transmission. The Department of Health and Social Services advises that community preparedness planning – recommended by CDC – should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their independence and their health. For family members and caregivers providing support, the CDC recommends these steps:  Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand. Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan. Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores. If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.  DPH continues to monitor travelers arriving in the U.S. from countries with a Level 2 or higher Travel Alert. The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14-day period, these persons are asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, the person should call DPH at 1-866-408-1899 immediately to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation and testing.

In a bulletin to insurance companies, the Commissioner reminded Delaware’s health insurers that testing for COVID-19 is a covered essential health benefit and that access to telehealth and telemedicine services should be made available. “Concerns around the cost of care for coronavirus may be a significant factor in residents deciding not to seek out medical interventions when symptoms arise, leading to negative health impacts on the individual, and an increased possibility of the spread of the virus,” said Commissioner Navarro. “Ensuring testing and expanding telemed options may be the biggest thing we can do to prevent the escalation of new transmissions.” The bulletin notes that some insurers have taken additional steps to meet the challenges posed by the virus, including waiving cost sharing. “I applaud those carriers who have committed to waiving upfront costs for their consumers. Residents may avoid being tested simply because they can’t afford to pay their co-pays or deductibles, and I commend the companies that are taking the barrier of economic ability out of the equation,” said Commissioner Navarro. In addition to ensuring COVID-19 testing is covered, whether at a testing facility or in emergency care, the bulletin also explains options surrounding telehealth and telemedicine and clarifies that healthcare providers can utilize webcam and facetime with their clients. Should active Delaware cases occur, medical facilities may experience a high level of activity. The bulletin specifies that care related to COVID-19 outside of the testing process should be considered in-network by health insurers if their in-network providers are unable to provide care in a timely fashion, in a safe and convenient location, or if they do not have trained, experienced providers of related care in-network. The department made clear that immunizations for COVID-19, if made available, should be covered by insurers, as would related prescription drugs. The bulletin also reminds insurers that Delaware law prohibits surprise billing. Delaware’s Division of Public Health (DPH) Smyrna Health Lab can test for COVID-19. Testing conducted by the Division of Public Health carries no costs to consumers. DPH has opened a COVID-19 hotline for residents at 1-866-408-1899, and will also respond to questions sent to DPHCall@delaware.gov. Visit de.gov/coronavirus for more information.

"Division of Public Health Urges At-Risk Populations to Follow CDC Guidance on Coronavirus Disease - State of Delaware News","Delaware Emergency Management Agency","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Monday, March 9, 2020","The Division of Public Health’s coronavirus call center at its State Health Operations Center (SHOC) in Smyrna is open to take questions from the public, schools, medical providers, state agencies and community organizations. The call center number is 1-866-408-1899. NEW CASTLE (March 9, 2020) – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) advises older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encouraging them to “avoid crowds as much as possible” as a way to reduce their risk of contracting coronavirus disease. The CDC has found that early data suggests older people are twice as likely to suffer a serious illness from coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Delaware has no confirmed cases, but DPH and other state partners are planning for the likelihood of community transmission. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recommended on Sunday that those at greatest risk – older Americans and those with severe chronic health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes – should abstain from travel. If you are in the higher-risk groups for getting very sick from COVID-19, the CDC recommends you should:  Avoid non-essential travel such as long plane trips and defer all cruise trips worldwide. Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated space, as much as possible. When you go out in public, including to doctor appointments or dialysis, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often. Take everyday precaution to keep space between yourself and others. If an outbreak does occur, stay home as much as possible. Stock up on supplies, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, food and water, and other household items. Have a plan in the event you get sick, including discussing with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what you might need.  “Because Delaware has a high percentage of older residents and people with severe underlying health conditions, we urge them and their families to follow the CDC’s recommendation to avoid crowds as much as possible,” said Department of Health of Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. “While we are grateful that we don’t have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our state, we are planning for community transmission of the disease. We urge Delawareans to take these important steps to reduce their exposure to the virus and to prepare when community transmission does happen here.” Older Delawareans, people with severe chronic health conditions and all other members of the public can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 or TTY at 1-800-232-5460 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Or email DPHCall@delaware.gov. For the latest on Delaware’s response, go to de.gov/coronavirus “Our efforts, where before they were focused on containment of the disease, are now focused on mitigating the impact of it when it does occur,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health. Delaware has no confirmed cases of COVID-19. As of March 9, 15 people have been tested in Delaware; all have been negative. In addition, testing and results are pending for three individuals, two in New Castle County, and one in Kent County. DPH is currently monitoring 18 returning travelers. The CDC also urges long-term care facilities to be vigilant in preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19. The Division of Public Health and DEMA are working with DHSS’ Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ), Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities (DSAAPD) and other community partners to implement strategies and restrictions to keep residents safe and healthy. Finally, DPH advises that community preparedness planning – recommended by CDC – should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their independence and their health. For family members and caregivers providing support, the CDC recommends these steps:  Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand. Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan. Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores. If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.  DPH continues to monitor travelers arriving in the U.S. from countries with a Level 2 or higher Travel Alert (China, Italy, Japan, Iran or South Korea). The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14-day period, these persons are asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, the person should call DPH at 1-866-408-1899 immediately to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation and testing. As of March 9, there are more than 111,000 cases of coronavirus disease worldwide, including more than 3,800 deaths. In the United States, there are more than 600 cases and 22 deaths to date. Consistent with the CDC’s guidance, Dr. Rattay said community spread is likely to continue increasing across the country. CDC officials also have said it is important for families and communities to prepare for what they would do if community spread occurs by recommending:  Schools review their infection prevention and control plans in the event there is a local outbreak. Employers review their contingency plans to ensure they are able to operate with adaptations and respond if an employee gets sick. Individuals and families understand steps they can take to help slow the spread of illness, including avoiding travel to hard-hit areas and staying home when sick.  DPH has a strong relationship with hospitals, EMS, and first responder agencies through its partnership with the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security (DSHS). Staff have been holding regular calls with hospitals, medical providers, school superintendents, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), DSHS and EMS agencies. Delaware is experiencing a particularly serious flu season with 6,000 lab-confirmed cases and 11 deaths statewide, and in addition to getting your flu shot, DPH recommends everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease:  Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails, for 20 seconds. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Do not touch your face, eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean commonly used surfaces such as computers, desktops, countertops cabinets, handles and more with disinfectant. Stay home when you are sick. If you are healthy, the CDC does not recommend buying or using face masks. You should only wear a mask if a health care provider tells you do so.  Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms (similar to the common cold) to people being severely ill and dying. For more information and updates related to COVID-19, visit the DPH website at de.gov/coronavirus, where materials can be found in English, Simplified Chinese/Mandarin, Spanish, and Haitian-Creole. In addition to updates on the global coronavirus disease outbreak, the website also contains tips for Delawareans, and the number of returning travelers that DPH is currently monitoring, which is updated regularly.

"Delaware Details Preparations for Potential Spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","Featured Video","Wednesday, February 26, 2020","Update: Watch Live at 1pm on March 2nd as state officials update the public on preparations Delaware is taking for Coronavirus, and the steps the public can take to prevent the spread.     DOVER  – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is actively taking steps to prepare for community spread of the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19, as well as providing information to Delawareans about the actions they can take now to make preparations. To date, no one in Delaware has tested positive for COVID-19. “While the CDC’s comments this week indicate heightened concern, it is important to note that we have been making preparations all along to not only contain the spread of the disease, should it occur in Delaware, but also to mitigate the impact of the virus if community spread were to occur,” said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. “As we continue to prepare for the likelihood of community spread in the U.S., we have begun stepping up our planning and preparedness efforts around mitigation strategies recommended by the CDC. In the coming days and weeks we will be having additional conversations with health care providers, schools, businesses and other state partners and stakeholders about what guidance to consider in the event of an outbreak locally.” As of February 25, there are more than 80,000 cases of coronavirus disease worldwide, including more than 2,700 deaths. There are 57 cases and no deaths to date in the United States. The CDC expects cases to continue to be confirmed in the upcoming days and weeks, but wants everyone to take action to help prevent the spread of the virus. There is currently no community spread of the disease in the U.S., including Delaware. CDC officials also said due to the rapidly changing nature of the spread of COVID-19 around the world, it is important for families to be prepared. CDC is recommending communities prepare for what they would do if community spread occurs by:  Recommending schools review their infection prevention and control plans in the event there is a local outbreak in the community. Recommending employers in the public and private sectors review their plans to ensure they are able to operate with adaptations like telework and flexible sick leave policies, as well as how to respond if an employee gets sick. Providing guidance to the public about the steps they can take that would help slow the spread of illness, including staying home when sick.  “The Division of Public Health is well-prepared to lead the response regarding coronavirus disease, and this is a time to enhance our preparedness efforts,” said Governor John Carney. “DPH has infectious disease outbreak plans in place that our public health experts regularly review and practice. Delaware’s plans are being used now to guide the state’s current public health activities, and those plans are flexible, allowing us to adapt to changing situations.” To date, Delaware:  Has activated the Division of Public Health’s State Health Operations Center to allow for enhanced response coordination; Maintains communication and outreach with federal, state and local partners; Coordinates testing for symptomatic persons with an associated travel history to China; Is monitoring asymptomatic (not sick) individuals returning from Mainland China to ensure they do not develop symptoms; Provides symptom monitoring guidance for residents returning to Delaware from China; Participates in frequent calls with health care systems, EMS and first responder agencies and other state agency partners; Provides information to health care professionals, businesses and educational settings; and Has reviewed and adapted current pandemic flu plans for COVID-19.  This health event is dynamic and evolving rapidly. DPH relies on accurate and up-to-date information from various federal and international partners to guide our preparedness and response efforts. DPH continues to follow the CDC’s guidance, and as new recommendations are released, we will continue to share that information as quickly as possible with our health care partners and the public. DPH has a strong relationship with hospitals, EMS, and first responder agencies through its partnership with the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security (DSHS). Staff have been holding regular calls with hospitals, DEMA and DSHS and EMS agencies to provide ongoing guidance about having and stocking appropriate protective equipment, and when it is needed, and providing support as needed. Delaware is experiencing a particularly serious flu season with over 5,000 cases and 11 deaths statewide, and DPH continues to recommend everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all germs – which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease: cover coughs and sneezes, stay home when sick, wash your hands frequently, and clean frequently touched surfaces often. While there is no vaccine yet against coronavirus, there is one to protect against influenza, and we still recommend getting it if you have not done so. Symptoms of the COVID-19 in people who have been exposed can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms (similar to the common cold) to people being severely ill and dying.

In addition, DPH continues to monitor 27 asymptomatic travelers (travelers who are not sick with fever/cough/shortness of breath) arriving in the U.S. from mainland China after Feb. 3. The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14 days after their return from China, these persons are being asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, they should call DPH right away to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation, isolation and testing. DPH is emphasizing that these individuals are not sick, and exhibit no symptoms consistent with coronavirus. Individuals being monitored for symptoms are NOT considered Patients Under Investigation (PUI), which are those individuals who meet criteria for testing based on symptoms and travel history. DPH began reporting the number of returning travelers being monitored, as well as PUIs, on its website https://dhss.delaware.gov/dph on Monday, Feb. 10. Numbers will be updated every Tuesday and Friday afterward. Individuals who traveled from China prior to Feb. 3, 2020, are asked to self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after their return. If they become ill within 14 days of their return, they should avoid contact with others, and call ahead to their health care provider to discuss their recent travel, symptoms, and next steps. The health care provider should in turn contact DPH to coordinate next steps. Individuals who returned from China prior to Feb. 3, 2020, do not need to be excluded from school or work. DPH continues to encourage employers and administrators to review their own health policies to make decisions regarding exclusion from work/school for these individuals. Both CDC and DPH continue to state that the risk of COVID-19 spreading to the general public remains low. While the number of cases are increasing in the U.S., there is no spread of the virus in the community. Risk is based on exposure. Only those individuals with recent travel to China or who have had contact with someone who has had recent travel and is ill, have an increased risk of becoming ill. For persons without an associated travel risk, it should be assumed that most respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. As of Feb. 3, 2020, all persons returning from Hubei Province in China, as well as symptomatic persons returning from mainland China, will be quarantined for 14 days near a United States airport of entry, per federal orders. DPH officials are also emphasizing that Asian American/Pacific Islander individuals are at no higher risk of carrying COVID-19 than any other individual. DPH urges people not to make assumptions that someone might be ill or could become ill based on their accent, background or skin color. DPH will continue to update the public as more information becomes available.

DPH, a division of DHSS, urges Delawareans to make healthier choices with the 5-2-1 Almost None campaign: eat 5 or more fruits and vegetables each day, have no more than 2 hours of recreational screen time each day (includes TV, computer, gaming), get 1 or more hours of physical activity each day, and drink almost no sugary beverages."
"DPH Announces Second Negative Test Result For Coronavirus - State of Delaware News","News","","","Thursday, February 13, 2020","DOVER – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing that one of two pending test results for 2019 novel coronavirus (now known as COVID-19) has come back negative. The individual has been discharged from the hospital and is continuing to recover from their underlying illness at home. Test results for one other person are still pending from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are expected in the coming days. The individual, a New Castle County resident, remains hospitalized until test results are returned. No additional information is being provided about either individual.

"Delaware Monitoring Returning Travelers from China for 2019 Novel Coronavirus - State of Delaware News","Delaware Health and Social Services","Division of Public Health","News","Friday, February 7, 2020","DOVER  – The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is providing an update on its efforts to monitor for potential cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). DPH continues to coordinate closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health care providers to identify potential cases, and has updated its guidance for risk assessment and monitoring travelers returning from China. “While there are currently no cases of 2019-nCoV in Delaware and the risk of this novel coronavirus spreading to the general public remains low, DPH is working to implement appropriate monitoring protocols and disease prevention strategies to further reduce any chance of transmission,” said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. “These protocols are based on not only our past experience with monitoring returning travelers during the Ebola outbreak, but also on CDC guidance and evolving knowledge about this virus.” Risk is based on exposure. Only those individuals with recent travel to China or those who had contact with someone who recently traveled and is ill have an increased risk of becoming ill. For persons without an associated travel risk, it should be assumed that respiratory illnesses are not 2019-nCoV. As of Feb. 3, 2020, all persons returning from Hubei Province in China, as well as symptomatic persons returning from mainland China, will be quarantined for 14 days near a United States airport of entry, per federal orders. All asymptomatic travelers (travelers who are not sick with fever/cough/shortness of breath) arriving from mainland China outside of Hubei Province will be monitored by DPH for symptoms for 14 days after their return. During that time, DPH (or its designee) will be in daily contact with those persons to check their status and health. Individuals will be asked to stay at home during this period while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, they should call DPH right away to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation, isolation and testing. Currently there are two individuals in Delaware who are being monitored. These persons are not sick, and exhibit no symptoms consistent with coronavirus. No additional information about these individuals will be provided. Individuals being monitored for symptoms are NOT considered Patients Under Investigation (PUI), which are those individuals who meet criteria for testing based on symptoms and travel history. There are no PUIs in Delaware at this time. DPH will begin reporting the number of returning travelers being monitored, as well as PUIs, on its website by Monday, Feb. 10.

DPH continues to encourage employers and administrators to review their own health policies to make decisions regarding exclusion from work/school for these individuals. As DPH continues to monitor the situation, health officials are also emphasizing that Asian American/Pacific Islander individuals are at no higher risk of carrying the 2019 novel coronavirus than any other individual. DPH urges people not to make assumptions that someone might be ill or could become ill based on their accent, background or skin color. “You are much more likely to become sick with a common cold virus or flu than to be diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus,” said Dr. Rattay. “Since the start of the flu season, there have been nearly 3,000 diagnosed cases of flu and we just learned of the seventh flu death this season in Delaware. Our Delaware residents of Chinese descent are important members of our community and are not at an increased risk for spreading the coronavirus.” Symptoms of 2019-nCoV are most similar to lower respiratory infections with patients having fever, cough and shortness of breath. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. Many individuals infected with 2019-nCoV recover with rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking over-the-counter medications to help relieve symptoms. If at any point laboratory testing confirms a case of 2019-nCoV in a Delaware resident, the available details and protective recommendations would be shared with both the affected parties and the public as quickly as possible. Right now, 2019-nCoV has not been found to be spreading widely in the United States, so there are no additional precautions recommended for the general public to take. The best guidance at this point is to take the same everyday precautions recommended for avoiding colds and flu: • Get your flu vaccine if you have not already. • Stay home when you are sick and avoid well people as much as possible. • Cover your coughs and sneezes. • Practice good hand hygiene – frequently wash hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. The U.S. Department of State issued a travel advisory on January 31, 2020, advising U.S. citizens not to travel to China due to the ongoing situation involving 2019-nCoV. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice, and commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China. If you are considering a trip to China, keep an eye on the news, federal travel advisories, and be aware of this evolving situation.
