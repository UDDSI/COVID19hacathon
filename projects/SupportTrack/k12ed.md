## PROBLEM STATEMENT

**TL;DR Are future student trajectories damaged by the quarantine?**

COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all communities in the US, however, it is becoming more and more evident 
that the impact of this disease has been especially more severe on marginalized communities including those 
with a lower 
SES which often includes persons of color. Identifying the patterns related to the characteristics of 
these groups and the levels that these individuals are and will potentially be impacted by the COVID crisis 
can aid  decision- and policy-making.
 
## DELIVERABLE:
We will build virtualized STEAM curriculum that UD students will deliver online to middle schoolers this summer.
- Have at least one interactive experience covering at least one appropriate topic.
 
## SKILLS NEEDED: 
- Empathy, 
- kindness, 
- web devs, 
- minecraft?, 
- child developmental models, 
- curricular passion

 
## DATA: 
Traditional pedagogical curriculum that needs adapting.
