## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

**TL;DR Explore the immpact of COVID19 across populations of different socioeconomic status in Delaware**

COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all communities in the US, however, it is becoming more and more evident 
that the impact of this disease has been especially more severe on marginalized communities including those 
with a lower 
SES which often includes persons of color. Identifying the patterns related to the characteristics of 
these groups and the levels that these individuals are and will potentially be impacted by the COVID crisis 
can aid  decision- and policy-making.
 
DELIVERABLE:
Two candidates for the projects in this area are visualizations and predictive models. 
- Visualization: clear and informative visualizations showing the of COVID-19 impacted on communities 
in different ranges of SES. Ideally, these visualizations would be accessible publicly (a website). 
- Analysis: Predictive models will be developed to provide estimates for the characteristics of the individuals who can be impacted by the pandemic.  This may be done retrospectively (using historical data for predicting already occurred events) or 
prospectively (using the available data for predicting future events).
 
SKILLS NEEDED: 
- Expertise/interest in dasic data analysis  (e.g, manipulating the dataset using MS Excel)
- Expertise/interest in data visualization (with a software of choice)
- Expertise/interest in web development (e.g., working with WordPress or more advanced tools)
- Basic coding proficiency (e.g., Python)
- Familiarity with a certain machine learning software package (e.g., scikit-learn, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Matlab)
