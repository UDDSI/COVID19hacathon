## Proposer: 
Federica Bianco (original idea Mia Papas & Tze Chiam)

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
**TL;DR In an increasingly online society, and with the perspective of recurrent outbreaks that force us to periods of social isolation, healthcare and education will become increasingly digital. What would this do to equitable access to health and education services?**

How would a redesigned primary care or primary education look? What resources are available and what resources are needed? The State of Delaware has a number of subpopulations with various degrees of access to broadband services (with those lacking access ranging from 0.0% to 27.3% depending on school district). With broadband access data and population demographics, assess the equity of online primary care and education and possible solutions.

DELIVERABLE: 

- Maps: a map or series of maps tracking broadband access and of the stress that moving primary care and/or education online would impose in different areas
- Recommandations: identify the locations in the State where the need for broadband access is most severe. 

## SKILLS NEEDED: 

- Expertise/interest in mapping (e.g. carto, geopandas, arcGIS)
- Expertise/interest in geospatial analysis
- Expertise/interest in data acquisition and manipulation from census (e.g. ACS) 
- Expertise/interest in analyzing socioeconomic data
