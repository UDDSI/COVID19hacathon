## Proposer: 
Federica Bianco (original idea Mia Papas & Tze Chiam)

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
*TL;DR In an increasingly online society, and with the perspective of recurrent outbreaks that force us to periods of social isolation, healthcare and education will become increasingly digital. How would a redesigned primary care or primary education look? Importantly, what would this do to equitable access to health and education services? The State of Delaware has a number of subpopulations with various degrees of access to broadband services (with those lacking access ranging from 0.0% to 27.3% depending on school district. With broadband access data and population demographics, assess the equity of online primary care and education and possible solutions.*

DELIVERABLE: 
A map of broadband access and of the stress that moving primary care and education online would impose. 

SKILLS NEEDED: 
Mapping (e.g. carto, geopandas, arcGIS), data acquisition and manipulation from census (e.g. ACS) 

DATA: 
Census data https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sis/resources/data-tools.html
DE maps (TIGER)
